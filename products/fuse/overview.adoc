JBoss Fuse includes industry-standard integration patterns so you can easily configure and manage a network of integration brokers. These patterns, when used with the flexible and low-cost ESB, allow you to deploy and connect customized solutions at every distributor, outlet, and partner, eliminating batch delivery and hub-and-spoke architectures forever.
