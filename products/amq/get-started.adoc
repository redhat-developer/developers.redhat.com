*Download, install and configure JBoss A-MQ:*

1. *Download and extract:*
+
a. Download the latest version of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ. The latest
at the time of this writing is link:#{site.download_manager_file_base_url}/jboss-amq-6.2.1.GA.zip[Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.1 GA].
b. Unzip JBoss-AQ to your favorite destination. The document will refer to this directory as AMQ_HOME (We use C:\opt\redhat\jboss-amq on Windows.)
* On Windows or Mac, you can extract the contents of the ZIP archive by double clicking on the ZIP file.
* On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, open a terminal window in the target machine and navigate to where the ZIP file was downloaded. Extract the ZIP file by executing the following command:
+
`unzip jboss-a-mq-6.2.1.redhat-084.zip`
+
2. *Add users to A-MQ:*
+
Edit the file `AMQ_HOME/etc/user.properties`. Uncomment the last line so that systems can connect and access the message broker. The last line of the user.properties file has a `#` mark as the first character. Delete it and save the file. The edited last line should now look similar to this:
+
`admin=admin,admin,manager,viewer,Operator,Maintainer,Deployer, Auditor,Administrator,SuperUser`
+
3. *Start the A-MQ broker:* Scripts to start and stop the A-MQ broker are found within the `AMQ_HOME/bin` directory.
* For Windows: Double-click on the `AMQ/bin/start.bat` file and accept security pop-ups as they appear.
* For Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Mac: Execute the following command:
+
`AMQ_HOME/bin/start`
+
TIP: To check the status of the A-MQ broker you can execute the status script found in the same directory as the start script. To learn more about the various scripts see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_A-MQ/6.2/html/Console_Reference/index.html[customer portal].​
+
* *Next Steps:* Congratulate yourself. You have just installed and started the JBoss A-MQ Broker. Next up, Install the developer environment...
