== Overview

Red Hat Mobile Application Platform lets teams extend their development capabilities to mobile by developing collaboratively, centralizing control of security and using back-end integration with a range of cloud deployments.

As a mobile developer you can work using the toolkits you know and like. You can discover and use and reuse MBaaS services to connect to common cloud services as well as integrate with enterprise systems, which gives you more time to spend on building your apps. You can write code on our platform to offload work from your app.
