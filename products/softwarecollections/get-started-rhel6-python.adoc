## Step3 Content

Under your normal user ID, start a _Terminal_ window. First, use `scl enable` to add {tthw-langlong} to your environment, then run {tthw-langshort} in interactive mode to see the version number:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
$ scl enable {tthw-sclname} bash
$ python3
Python 3.4.2 (default, Mar 25 2015, 02:43:36) 
>>> print("Hello, Red Hat Developers World")
Hello, Red Hat Developers World
>>> quit()
----

The next step is to create a {tthw-langshort} program that can be run from the command line. Using a text editor such as `vi`, `nano`, or `gedit` create a file named `{tthw-hellofile}` with the following content:


.hello.py
[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

version = "Python %d.%d" % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor)
print("Hello, Red Hat Developers World from",version)
----

Save it and exit the editor. Then make the script executable and run it:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
$ chmod +x {tthw-hellofile}
$ ./{tthw-hellofile}
Hello, Red Hat Developers World from {tthw-langlong}
----

If you get the error: _{tthw-langcmd} command not found_, or see a different version number, you need to run `scl enable {tthw-sclname} bash` first.

. *When I type ‘python’, I get Python 2 instead of Python 3.*
+
RHSCL does not alter the system path.  You need to use `scl enable` to change the environment for your session. Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes Python 2. To avoid ambiguity, use `python3` instead of `python`. See the next question for more information.

. *Some Python code/examples I’ve tried don’t work with Python 3 from RHSCL.*
+
Python 3.x is a new version of the Python language that is incompatible with the previous 2.x series. The version of Python included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux in `/usr/bin/python` is from the Python 2.x series. There is a large amount of code written for Python 2.x that will not run without modification on Python 3.x.
+
For more information see link:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3[Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?] at link:https://python.org[Python.org].
+
After you have added Python 3 to your environment by using `scl enable`, the command `python` as well as `python3` will run Python 3 from RHSCL. Python 2 can be run by using the command `python2` with or without RHSCL. Therefore, it is recommended that you use either the command `python2` or `python3` to ensure that you get the version you are expecting.

. *Some existing Python programs fail after I’ve enabled Python 3 from RHSCL.*
+
See the previous question about Python 2 and Python 3 incompatibility. Scripts that have a first line of  `#!/usr/bin/env python` will pick up which ever version of Python is first in your path. This is usually done to avoid hard coding a specific location like `/usr/bin` or `/usrlocal/bin`. Unfortunately on a system with both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, this is ambiguous.
+
To fix the problem, change the first line to specify `/usr/bin/python` or `python2`:
+
`\#!/usr/bin/python` or `#!/usr/bin/env python2`
