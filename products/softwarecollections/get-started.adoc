## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will set your system up to install software from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL), which provides the latest development technologies for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Then, you will Install Python 3.4 and run a simple “Hello, World” application. The whole tutorial will take less than ten minutes to complete.

You will need a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system with a current Red Hat subscription that allows you to download software and updates from Red Hat. Access to the Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) is included with many Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscriptions. For more information about which subscriptions include RHSCL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)?]

If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].
Select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation will include both RHSCL and DTS.

If you have problems at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step1 Content

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software, including the latest dynamic languages, from the RHSCL software repository. Instructions are provided for both the command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

### Using the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI

Red Hat Subscription Manager can be started from the _System Tools_ group of the _Applications Menu_. Alternatively, you can start it from the command prompt by typing `subscription-manager-gui`. +

Select _Repositories_ from the System menu of the subscription manager. In the list of repositories, check the _Enabled_ column for _rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-server-optional-rpms_. If you are using a desktop version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the repositories will be named _rhel-desktop-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-desktop-optional-rpms_. Note: After clicking, it might take several seconds for the check mark to appear in the enabled column. +
 
If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list your subscription may not include it, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information. +

### Using subscription-manager from the command line

You can add or remove software repositories from the command line using the `subscription-manager` tool as root. Use the --list option to view the available software repositories and verify that you have access to RHSCL:

[.code-block]
```
$ su
# subscription-manager repos --list | egrep rhscl
```

If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list your subscription may not include it, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

If you are using a desktop edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, change `-server-` to `-desktop-` in the following commands.

[.code-block]
```
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```

## Step2 Content

In this next step you will Install Python 3.4 from RHSCL.

`$ su` +
`# yum install rh-python34`

If you need help, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step3 Content

Under your normal user id, start a terminal session.  First, we will use scl enable to add Python 3 to your environment, then we will run Python 3 in interactive mode.

[.code-block]
```
$ scl enable rh-python34 bash
$ python3
Python 3.4.2 (default, Mar 25 2015, 04:25:42)
>>> print("Hello, Red Hat Developers World")
Hello, Red Hat Developers World
>>> quit()
```

Now we will create a Python program that can be run from the command line. Using your preferred text editor, create hello.py:

`$ nano hello.py`

Add the following text:
[.code-block]
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

version = "Python %d.%d" % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor)
print("Hello, Red Hat Developers World from",version)
```

Save it and exit the editor. Then make the script executable and run it:
[.code-block]
```
$ chmod +x hello.py
$ ./hello.py
Hello, Red Hat Developers World from Python 3.4
```

If you get an error that Python3 is not found, you need to run `scl enable rh-python34 bash` first.

### Working with RHSCL packages

The software packages in RHSCL are designed to allow multiple versions of software to be installed concurrently. To accomplish this, the desired package is added to your runtime environment as needed by running scl enable package. When scl enable is run it modifies environment variables which only affects the current shell and any processes that are run from it. The changes aren’t permanent, so scl enable needs to be run at each login.

While it is possible to change the system profile to make RHSCL packages part of the system’s global environment this is not recommended as this can cause conflicts and unexpected problems with other applications as the system version of the package would be effectively replaced by the RHSCL version.

#### Permanently enable RHSCL in your development environment

To make one or more RHSCL packages a permanent part of your development environment, you can add it to the login script for your specific user id. this is the recommend approach for development as only processes run under your user id will be affected.

Using your preferred text editor, add the following line to the end of `~/.bashrc`.

`source scl_source enable rh-python34`

After making the change, you should log out and back in again.

When you deliver an application that uses RHSCL packages, a best practice is to have your startup script handles the scl enable step for your application. You should not ask your users to change their environment as this is likely to create conflicts with other applications.

[[troubleshooting]]Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section

1. The rhscl repository is not available or is not found on my system.
+
The name of the repo depends on whether you have ‘server’ or ‘desktop’ version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installed.
+
Some Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscriptions do not include access to RHSCL. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)?]
2. yum install fails due to a missing dependency such as scl-utils-build or texlive-*.
+
These packages are in the RHEL Optional RPMS repository which is not enabled by default. See the “Enable Red Hat Software Collections” step of this tutorial for how to enable both the Optional RPMS and RHSCL repositories.
3. How can I find out what RHSCL packages are installed?
+
scl --list will show the list of RHSCL packages that have been installed whether they are enabled or not.
+
[.code-block]
```
$ scl --list
rh-perl520
rh-php56
rh-python34
rh-ruby22
```
4. How do I find out if there is a newer version of Python in the RHSCL?
+
How do I find out what version of Python is available in the RHSCL?
+
I have the RHSCL repository enabled, but I can’t find the Python version listed in this tutorial?
+
`# yum list available rh-python\*`
5. I’ve installed Python 3.4 from RHSCL, but it is not in my path?
+
I can’t find python3?
+
When I type ‘python’, I get Python 2 instead of Python 3?
+
RHSCL does not alter the system path.  You need to use scl enable to change the PATH for your session:
+
`$ scl enable rh-python34 bash`
+
For more information see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/2/index.html[Red Hat Software Collection 2.0 Documentation]
6. When I try to run Python 3, I get an error about a missing shared library, libpython3?
+
This is due to not having run ‘scl enable’ first. When scl enable is run, in addition to setting up the command search path, it also sets up the search path for shared libraries, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
7. Some Python examples/code I’ve tried doesn’t work with Python 3 from RHSCL?
+
Python 3.x is a new version of the Python language that is incompatible with the previous 2.x series. The version of Python included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux in /usr/bin/python is from the Python 2.x series. There is a large amount of code written for Python 2.x that will not run without modification on Python 3.x.
+
For more information see link:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3[“Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?”] at link:python.org[Python.org]
+
After you have added Python3 to your environment by using scl enable, the command ‘python’ as well as ‘python3’ will run Python 3 from RHSCL. Python 2 can be run by using the command ‘python2’ with or without RHSCL. Therefore, it is recommend you use either the command ‘python2’ or ‘python3’ to ensure you get the version you are expecting.
8. Some existing Python programs fail after I’ve enabled Python 3 from RHSCL?
+
See the previous question about Python 2 and Python 3 incompatibility. Scripts that have a first line of  `#!/usr/bin/env python`, will pick up which ever version of Python is in your path. This is usually done in order to avoid hard coding a specific location like /usr/bin or /usrlocal/bin. Unfortunately on a system with both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, this is ambiguous.
+
To fix the problem, change the first line to specify /usr/bin/python or python2:
+
`\#!/usr/bin/python` *or* `#!/usr/bin/env python2`
