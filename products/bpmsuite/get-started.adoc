### Getting Started
The best way to discover a new product is to get hands-on with the product.
We have put together an online http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/[JBoss BPM Suite workshop], where you are introduced to the product in an overview presentation before embarking on installing and building the project.
You will be building an HR employee rewards process project that includes human tasks, domain specific nodes, and a process, all within the latest JBoss BPM Suite product.
The http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/5[Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite - HR Employee Rewards Demo] is laid out with links and video to all the available material for exploring this project.
