== Download

The CDK makes it easy to get started building containers on Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or Linux. After you have your Red Hat developer subscription, download the following components to get started.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide[Container Development Kit Installation Guide] for complete installation instructions.

=== 1. Virtualization platform (hypervisor)

The CDK delivers the latest container tools in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine (VM). You will need a virtualization platform (hypervisor) to run the VM. First, install your choice of:

* link:http://virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox]
* link:http://vmware.com/[VMware]
* Linux KVM/libvirt

=== 2. Vagrant

Next, download link:http://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant], an open source tool for creating and distributing portable development environments. All of the VM configuration detalis on your development system will be handled for you by Vagrant.

*NOTE:* We recommend you use Vagrant version 1.7.4, or a version *later than 1.8.1*. Vagrant releases 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 should be avoided due to some bugs that impact proper operation of the CDK.

If you are using:

* Microsoft Windows 7 and later, link:https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.msi[download the Vagrant `.msi` universal installer].
* Apple Mac OS X, link:https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.dmg[download the Vagrant `.dmg` universal installer].
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux, install the _Vagrant software collection_ using the instructions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide].
* CentOS Linux, install the _Vagrant software collection_ using the instructions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide].
* Fedora 23, install the Vagrant packages included with Fedora using `dnf`. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide].

For other Linux distributions, install Vagrant using the packages included with your distribution if it includes a recent version. Alternatively, download a `.deb` or `.rpm` package from link:https://vagrantup.com/downloads.html[vagrantup.com].

=== 3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux CDK download

From the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/293/ver=2/rhel---7/2.0.0/x86_64/product-software[Red Hat CDK 2 download page] you need to download two files:

* First, download _Red Hat Container Tools_. You will get a `.zip` file containing CDK components that should be unpacked on your development (host) system.
* Second, download the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 CDK Vagrant Box_ that matches your virtualization platform, e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, or libvirt (KVM).


== Getting started

To get started using the Red Hat CDK:

* Follow the instructions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide[Container Development Installation Guide] to install the CDK.
* Read link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-container-development-kit/[Getting Started with Container Development Kit] to learn what is included with the CDK and how to use it.
