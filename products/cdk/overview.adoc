== Overview

The Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) simplifies the setup and configuration of your container development environment and gets you on your way to building container-based applications - even if you’re developing from Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or other Linux platforms. Utilizing multiple technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, Atomic App, and others, the CDK provides users with tools to more quickly create container-based applications that can then be deployed on: +

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* OpenShift Enterprise 3
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host

For developers who are interested in creating applications for Red Hat’s Platform-as-a-Service offering, OpenShift Enterprise 3, the timing couldn’t be better: download the CDK and related components now and write your applications for DevOps, cloud, and more.

[.callout-light]
Developing container-based applications for a Red Hat platform typically requires a Red Hat Enterprise Linux developer subscription, but on occasion and for a limited time, Red Hat may offer a complimentary no-charge RHEL developer subscription for your container application development.  So now available, the *first 500 Container Development Kit beta testers will receive a free RHEL Developer Suite subscription-* so register now and build some hot container applications!

If you work for a Red Hat technology partner (e.g. Independent Software Vendor, ISV), we recommend also joining the Red Hat Connect for Technology Partner program to obtain access to a number of subscriptions for your container application development.  Of particular interest is a new Container Certification-as-a-Service that Red Hat provides to validate and authenticate your application as a trusted solution.  Join the “Container Zone” at connect.redhat.com - it’s all free!
