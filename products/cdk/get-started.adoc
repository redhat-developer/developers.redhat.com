## Windows Step1

The easiest way to install the Red Hat Container Development Kit is to use the Red Hat Development Suite installer.

. Download the link:#{site.download_manager_file_base_url}/cdk/development-suite-1.0.0-GA-bundle-installer.exe[Red Hat Development Suite 1.0] installer
. Double click on the downloaded file to launch the installer. If you have User Account Control enabled, you will need to click _Yes_ to allow  the installer to run with adminstrator-level permissions.
. Enter your Red Hat Developers username and password, and click _Login_.

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* If you haven't directly downloaded the Red Hat Development Suite from Red Hat Developers, your account may not have the correct entitlements to install the Container Development Kit. The easiest way to add the entitlements is to visit Red Hat Developers and initiate a download of the Red Hat Development Suite. We are working on a fix to enable you to add the entitlements to your account without starting a new download.
. Choose the folder you wish to use to install Red Hat Development Suite, and click _Continue_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/cdk/DevSuite_Screen_2.png')}[Choose Install Location]
+ 
. By default, Red Hat Development Suite includes Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio and Open JDK. To prevent them being installed, first locate _RED HAT JBOSS DEVELOPER STUDIO_ and ensure it is unchecked, then locate _OPENJDK_ and ensure it is unchecked. Then Click _Download & Install_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/cdk/DevSuite_Screen_3.png')}[Choose Components]
+ 
. The Red Hat Development Suite installer will then download the Container Development Kit and any supporting components it detects are required (Vagrant, Cygwin and Oracle VirtualBox).
+

## Mac And Linux Step1

In this step, you download the first of two Red Container Development Kit (CDK) files. For the download, you will need to register with developers.redhat.com. After you register as a developer, you will be given a subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite, which will give you access to the CDK. Developer Suite includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, and additional development tools.
Download the link:#{site.download_manager_file_base_url}/cdk-2.1.0.zip[cdk-2.1.0.zip].

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* The Red Hat Development Suite is not yet available on Mac or Linux, so manual installation is required.

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* Later in this guide, you will need the Red Hat username and password you create during registration for accessing Red Hat sites.

## Mac And Linux Step2

The Container Development Kit delivers the latest container runtime enviornment and container tools in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine (VM). To use the kit you will need:

. A virtualization platform: http://virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox, window='_blank'], Linux KVM/libvirt, or Hyper-V
. http://www.vagrantup.com/about.html[Vagrant, window='_blank'], an open source tool for creating and distributing portable development environments.
. The CDK Red Hat Enterprise Linux Vagrant box that matches your virtualization platform.
. https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin, window='_blank'] (Microsoft Windows only) to provide `ssh` and `rsync`.

### Install a virtualization platform (hypervisor)

First, download and install a virtualization platform:

* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox, window='_blank'] (For Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or Linux)
* Linux KVM/libvirt (For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora)
* Windows Hyper-V (For Microsoft Windows)

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* If you are using Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or a Linux distribution other than Red Hat, Fedora or CentOS, VirtualBox is recommended.

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* Hyper-V support is only available on certain versions of Windows such as Windows 10 Pro. To enable Hyper-V right click on the _Start Menu_, select _Programs and Features, click on _Turn Windows features on or off_, make sure the checkbox next to _Hyper-V_ is selected, and click _OK_. Windows may need to restart to install Hyper-V - follow any prompts.

### Install Vagrant

Next, install Vagrant. All of the Container Development Environment configuration and managment on your development system will be handled for you by Vagrant.

[.callout-light]
*NOTE:* We recommend you use Vagrant version 1.7.4, or a version *later than 1.8.1* on Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X. Vagrant releases 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 should be avoided due to some bugs that impact proper operation of the kit.

If you are using:

* Microsoft Windows 7 and later, https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.msi[download the Vagrant `.msi` universal installer, window='_blank'].
* Apple Mac OS X, https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.dmg[download the Vagrant `.dmg` universal installer, window='_blank'].
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux, install the _Vagrant software collection_ using the instructions in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide, window='_blank'].
* CentOS Linux, install the _Vagrant software collection_ using the instructions in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide, window='_blank'].
* Fedora 23, install the Vagrant packages included with Fedora using `dnf`. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[CDK Installation Guide, window='_blank'].

For other Linux distributions, install Vagrant using the packages included with your distribution if it includes a recent version. Alternatively, download a `.deb` or `.rpm` package from https://vagrantup.com/downloads.html[vagrantup.com, window='_blank'].


### Install Cygwin on Microsoft Windows

To provide `ssh` and `rsync` on Microsoft Windows, install http://cygwin.com/install.html[Cygwin, window='_blank'] by downloading and running:

* http://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe[setup-x86.exe, window='_blank'] for 32-bit versions of Windows.
* http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe[setup-x86_64.exe, window='_blank'] for 64-bit versions of Windows.


### Download the Container Runtime Environment

Next, download the environment that matches your virtualization platform:

// FIXME These will need to be updated for GA and later.
* #{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/file/rhel-cdk-kubernetes-7.2-25.x86_64.vagrant-virtualbox.box[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Vagrant box for VirtualBox, window='_blank']
* #{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/file/rhel-cdk-kubernetes-7.2-25.x86_64.vagrant-libvirt.box[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Vagrant box for KVM/libvirt, window='_blank']
* #{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/file/rhel-cdk-kubernetes-7.2-26.x86_64.vagrant-hyperv.box[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Vagrant box for Hyper-V, window='_blank']

## Mac And Linux Step3

Next, install the Container Development Kit by following the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/[CDK Installation Guide, window='_blank'] for your operating system:

* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_microsoft_windows[Installing the CDK on Microsoft Windows, window='_blank']
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_mac_os_x[Installing the CDK on Apple Mac OS X, window='_blank']
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[Installing the CDK on Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, window='_blank']
