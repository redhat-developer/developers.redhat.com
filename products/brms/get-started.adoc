## Extra section

The purpose of this kit is to provide the means to get started with the http://developers.redhat.com/products/brms[Red Hat JBoss BRMS] product, from introduction, to installation, to using the product to build a first application.

It will present the available content in a logical order, providing a learning path for first time users. With the video tutorials designed to be non-specific to a version, these initial steps will save you time spinning up your first process application or project. Just follow the numbered steps below and you will be on your way to mastering JBoss BRMS.

This starters kit is currently targeting the product link:#{site.download_manager_file_base_url}/jboss-brms-6.1.0.GA-installer.jar[JBoss BRMS 6.1].

### 1. Target audience
Anyone interested in getting started quickly with http://developers.redhat.com/products/brms[JBoss BRMS]:

* Developers evaluating open source rules and events tooling
* Architects tasked with evaluating technology for potential use in organization
* Business or information analysts interested in exploring rule design tooling

### 2. Rules, events and processes
Before you get started with products in this technology space, a bit of a background on what rules, events and processes are about in relation to JBoss offerings is in order. Here you will find a nice http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/introduction.html[walk through the concepts] as they can be applied using JBoss products, all in around 15 minutes.

### 3. Get the products
The first thing one needs is the product, so with JBoss BRMS this means we want the installer and a JBoss EAP server to install this onto. We have two options depending on the what you are looking for:

1. https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html[Red Hat Customer Portal] - hosts all available versions of JBoss EAP & JBoss BRMS that you can access via your credentials when you have a valid subscription for JBoss BRMS product.
2. http://developers.redhat.com/products/brms/download[Red Hat Developers JBoss BRMS Product Page] - hosts selected major versions of JBoss BRMS and you can get selected versions of JBoss EAP without a full subscription. You only need a valid Red Hat Developer account and agree to a $0 developer subscription before gaining access to the available versions for download.

Below you will find demo projects that are based on various versions of the products, some of which you can preview without a subscription by downloading at Red Hat Developers product pages. Please check the revisions available to pull a tagged version of a project that uses product versions you want to try out.

### 4. Quick video tour
The list of videos in this section are provided as an introduction and orientation to the product as a whole. They are intended to get you ready to use JBoss BRMS and take your first small steps into the world of process applications.

This series will not take you through how to use the product beyond installation and a tour, the rest will be left for the workshops below.

### 5. How it's done
There is an extensive collection of example demo projects that range from a simple clean JBoss BRMS installation to more complex multi-product integration scenarios and everything in between.

Each demo project has the same consistent template, the same user login unless specified in the documentation and install in exactly the same way as shown in the Quick Tour videos above. Not all, but where possible, there are three options for installation and running the demo projects:

1. Install on your local machine
2. Install with one-click on xPaaS (bpmPaas)
3. Generate a containerized installation

Here you have a list with some details as to the contents of each of the demo projects ranging from the simple to the most advanced.

### 6. Get hands on with workshops
The best way to discover a new technology is without a doubt to get hands-on with the product.

We have put together an online http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/#/4[JBoss BRMS workshop], where you are introduced to the product in an overview presentation before embarking on installing and building the project. We have two workshops available for you, one simple and one that is more complex.

The http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/brms6_1/lab01.html[Red Hat JBoss BRMS Cool Store workshop] is laid out with links, video and guided steps you need to build the entire project from scratch:

image::#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/brms/brms-workshop-2.png')}[link="http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/brms6_1/lab01.html"]

#### Workshop in the Cloud
The workshop can be loaded into the Cloud on your own OpenShift account, just follow the https://github.com/eschabell/openshift-brms-workshop[project introduction page] instructions:

1. Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/
2. Create a PHP application in online admin console for using cli tooling:

`rhc app create brmsworkshop -t php-5.4 --from-code git://github.com/eschabell/openshift-brms-workshop.git`

That's it, you can now start your workshop at:

`http://brmsworkshop-$your_domain.rhcloud.com`

#### Workshops in a can
Looking for an easy way to promote, present or demonstrate how easy it is to get started with JBoss BRMS product?

Look no further as we have pulled together a few workshops so that you can construct an evening, half day or full day session of learning around JBoss BPM Suite. You can setup this workshop and run it at any event as it can be constructed to take from a half to full day to complete. Think of the following possibilities for this workshop:

* local Java User Group (JUG)
* local JBoss User Group (JBug)
* local tech meetup
* work interest group
* after hours meetup at work
* submit it to a conference (yes you can use this!)

The workshop outlines how to build an online retail shopping cart project that uses all the rules and events that JBoss BRMS offers. Not only that, you get to build them all hands on with the various web based tooling that the product offers:
