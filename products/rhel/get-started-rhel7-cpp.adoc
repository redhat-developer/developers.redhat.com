Get started developing with C++ on Red Hat Enterprise Linux in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and build a simple {cpp} Hello World application.  This tutorial should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

Before you begin, you will need a current Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 workstation or server subscription that allows you to download software and get updates from Red Hat. If you don’t have an active subscription, register and obtain the RHEL Developer Suite (includes RHEL server) from link:#{site.base_url}/downloads/[here].

If you encounter difficulties at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step3 Title
Hello World and your first application

## Step1 Content

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates from Red Hat for your system. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu.  Then after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat Software Repositories.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

`# yum update`



## Step2 Content

In this next step you will use a single command to download and install the GCC C and {cpp} compilers as well as other development tools. You should still have the previous _Terminal_ window open, and still be running under `su`.

`# yum install @development`

Your system might already have these tools installed if you selected the _Development Tools_ package collection during installation. In this case, `yum` will return _Nothing to do_.

The steps that need to be run as root have been completed, so type `exit` to return to your normal user ID.

[.code-block]
```
# exit
$
```



## Step3 Content

In this step you will create and run the {cpp} Hello World application.  You should still have a _Terminal_ window open running under your regular user ID.

Now create `hello.cpp` using your preferred text editor or simply use `cat`:

[.code-block]
```
$ cat > hello.cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  cout << "Hello, Red Hat Developers World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Type `control-d` to exit `cat`, or if you used an editor save the file and exit.

Now compile and run the program:

[.code-block]
```
$ pass:[g++] -o hello hello.cpp
$ ./hello
Hello, Red Hat Developers World!
```

## Faq section title
[[troubleshooting]]Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section
1. My system is unable to download updates from Red Hat.
+
I don't have a current Red Hat subscription, can I get an evaluation?
+
If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].  Developers should select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation includes additional tools from the Red Hat Developer Toolset and Red Hat Software Collections.
+
2. Which version of GCC am I using?
+
Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes a version of the GNU compiler collection that is supported for the same lifecycle as the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are supported for up to 10 years.
+
Use `pass:[g++] -v` to see what version you have installed.
+
[.code-block]
```
$ pass:[g++] -v
gcc version 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-9) (GCC)
```
+
3. How can I obtain a newer version of GCC/pass:[G++]?
+
Red Hat Developer Toolset provides the latest, stable, open source C and {cpp} compilers and complementary development tools including Eclipse. DTS enables developers to compile applications once and deploy across multiple versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The Red Hat Developer Toolset uses Red Hat Software Collections to install a parallel set of packages in `/opt/rh` where they will not override the system packages that come with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat Software Collections is available with select Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions and has a three-year life cycle to allow rapid innovation without sacrificing stability.
