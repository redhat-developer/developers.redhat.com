Get started developing with Perl on Red Hat Enterprise Linux in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will see how to get started with Perl development on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by creating a simple Hello World application. The tutorial should take five to ten minutes to complete.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Perl is installed by default. You can skip directly to the "Your First Application" step, or continue reading to learn more about installing and maintaining software packages.

Before you begin, you will need a current Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 workstation or server subscription that allows you to download software and get updates from Red Hat. If you don’t have an active subscription, register and obtain the RHEL Developer Suite (includes RHEL server) from link:#{site.base_url}/downloads/[here].

If you have problems at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

Hello World and your first application

## Step1 Content

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates from Red Hat for your system. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu.  Then after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat Software Repositories.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

`# yum update`


## Step2 Content

Perl and a number of popular Perl modules are installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To see what Perl packages are already installed, run the following `yum` command after becoming root with `su`. If you don't already have a Terminal window open, start one from the _Applications_ menu.

[.code-block]
```
$ su +
# yum list installed perl\*
```

If Perl wasn't installed or needed an update, you would only need to run one `yum` command.

`# yum install perl`

To see what other Perl modules are included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, run this command:

`# yum list available perl\*`

You are now done with the part that requires root privileges. Type `exit` to return to your normal user ID.

[.code-block]
```
# exit
$
```


If you need help, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.


## Step3 Content

In this step, you will create and run a Perl application. If you don't have a Terminal window open, start it from the _Applications_ menu.  You should run under your normal user ID,  If you are still using su to run as the root user, type `exit`.

Using your preferred text editor, create hello.pl:

`$ nano hello.pl`

Add the following text:

[.code-block]
```
#!/usr/bin/env perl
#
print "Hello, Red Hat Developers World from Perl $^V\n";
```

Save it and exit the editor. Then make the script executable and run it:

[.code-block]
```
$ chmod +x hello.pl
$ ./hello.pl
Hello, Red Hat Developers World from Perl v5.10.1
```
