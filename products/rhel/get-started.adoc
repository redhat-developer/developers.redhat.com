## Step1 Content

In this step, you will download Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the Red Hat customer portal, link:https://access.redhat.com/[access.redhat.com]. The steps are:

. Log in to link:https://access.redhat.com/[access.redhat.com].
+
If you don't have an account, link:https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html[register to create one].
+
. Download the _binary DVD .iso file_ for link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/x86_64/product-downloads[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server].
+
On the download page, under _Product Variant_ select _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server_. Choosing the _Server_ edition gives you the widest range of software to develop and test with. During installation you will choose the _Server with a GUI_ option for a full graphical desktop.
+
Under _Version_ select the latest released (non-beta) version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The _Architecture_ selection should be set to _x86_64_.
+
Click the _Download Now_ button for _Binary DVD_ installer. The file size should be between 3 and 4 GBs. Do not select the much smaller _Boot ISO_ as it doesn't contain the installation software.

Instructions for making a bootable https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-making-media.html#sect-making-cd-dvd-media[DVD] or https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/sect-making-usb-media.html[USB] drive can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-making-media.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

## Step2 Baremetal Content

This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. You will need to select an _Installation destination_, which is the disk or partition(s) where the software will be installed. *The disk or partition(s) you select will be overwritten.* Make sure you understand your selection before starting the installation to avoid accidental data loss.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.
. Create your primary user account during installation: After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. The regular user will be your primary login for development. The root account should only be used for system administration tasks. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need to reboot and then log in as root to create user accounts.

### Installation instructions

### Install the latest updates

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates for your system from Red Hat. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu.  Then, after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat software repositories. 

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

`# yum update`

### Enable additional software repositories

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software from the RHSCL software repository. The RHSCL repository includes the both the RHSCL software collections as well as DTS (the Red Hat Developer Toolset). RHSCL includes the latest stable versions of dynamic languages, open source databases, and web development tools that can be deployed alongside those included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. DTS provides the latest, stable, open source C and {cpp} compilers and complementary development tools, including Eclipse.  

Instructions are provided for both the command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

#### Using the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI

Red Hat Subscription Manager can be started from the _System Tools_ group of the _Applications_ menu. Alternatively, you can start it from the command prompt by typing `subscription-manager-gui`. +

. On the Subscription Manager _System_ menu, select _Repositories_.
. In the list of repositories, check the _Enabled_ column for _rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-server-optional-rpms_. Note: After clicking, it might take several seconds for the check mark to appear in the _Enabled_ column. +
 
If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list, your subscription might not include it.
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/softwarecollections/softwarecollections_install_1.png')}[Manage Repositories]

See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information. +


#### Using subscription-manager from the command line

You can add or remove software repositories from the command line using the `subscription-manager` tool as the root user. Use the `--list` option to view the available software repositories and verify that you have access to RHSCL, which includes DTS:

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list | egrep rhscl
```

If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list, your subscription might not include it. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

[.code-block]
```
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```
