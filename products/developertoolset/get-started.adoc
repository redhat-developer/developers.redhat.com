Get started with Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS) for gcc (C, C++, and/or Fortran) development - access and install DTS and optionally in a container on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  This is a “quick start” excerpt from the entire https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Developer Toolset User Guide].  

# 1. Getting access to Red Hat Developer Toolset (20 minutes) 

Red Hat Developer Toolset is an offering that is distributed as a part of the Red Hat Software Collections content set, which is available to customers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 subscriptions listed at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793]. Depending on the subscription management service with which you registered your Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, you can either enable Red Hat Developer Toolset by using the Red Hat Subscription Management, or by using RHN Classic. 

For detailed instructions on how to enable Red Hat Software Collections (and thus gain access to Red Hat Developer Toolset) using RHN Classic or Red Hat Subscription Management, see the respective section below. For information on how to register your system with one of these subscription management services, see the Red Hat Subscription Management collection of guides. 	

Important. Red Hat Developer Toolset 3.1 is only compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6.5 and higher and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 6.5 and higher. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Compatibility.html#figu-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Compatibility[Figure 1.1, “Red Hat Developer Toolset 3.1 Compatibility Matrix”.] 	

## 1. Access DTS Using Red Hat Subscription Management

If your system is registered with Red Hat Subscription Management, complete the following steps to attach a subscription that provides access to the repository for Red Hat Software Collections (which includes Red Hat Developer Toolset), and then enable that repository: 		

Determine the pool ID of a subscription that provides Red Hat Software Collections (and thus also Red Hat Developer Toolset). To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root to display a list of all subscriptions that are available for your system.
			
  subscription-manager list --available

For each available subscription, this command displays its name, unique identifier, expiration date, and other details related to your subscription. The pool ID is listed on a line beginning with ‘Pool ID’. 				

For a complete list of subscriptions that provide access to Red Hat Developer Toolset, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793. 				

### 1.1 Attach the appropriate subscription to your system by running the following command as root: 				

  subscription-manager attach --pool=pool_id

Replace 'pool_id' with the pool ID you determined in the previous step. To verify the list of subscriptions your system has currently attached, at any time, run as root: 				

  subscription-manager list --consumed

### 1.2 Determine the exact name of the Red Hat Software Collections repository. 

To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root to retrieve repository metadata and to display a list of available *Yum* repositories: 
				
  subscription-manager repos --list

The repository names depend on the specific version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux you are using and are in the following format: 				

  rhel-variant-rhscl-version-rpms
  rhel-variant-rhscl-version-debug-rpms
  rhel-variant-rhscl-version-source-rpms

In addition, certain packages, such as devtoolset-3-gcc-plugin-devel, depend on packages that are only available in the *Optional* channel. The repository names with these packages use the following format: 				

  rhel-version-variant-optional-rpms
  rhel-version-variant-optional-debug-rpms
  rhel-version-variant-optional-source-rpms

For both the regular repositories and optional repositories, replace variant with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system variant (server or workstation), and version with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system version (6-eus, 6, or 7). 				

### 1.3 Enable the repositories from the privious step by running the following command as 'root': 				

  subscription-manager repos --enable repository

Replace ‘repository’ with the name of the repository to enable. 				
	
## 2. Access DTS Using RHN Classic

If you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and your system is registered with RHN Classic, complete the following steps to subscribe to Red Hat Software Collections (which includes Red Hat Developer Toolset): 	
	
### 2.1 Determine the exact name of the Red Hat Software Collections channel. 

To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root to display a list of all channels that are available to you: 				

  rhn-channel --available-channels

The name of the channel depends on the specific version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux you are using and is in the following format: 		
		
  rhel-x86_64-variant-version-rhscl-1

In addition, certain packages, such as devtoolset-3-gcc-plugin-devel, depend on packages that are only available in the *Optional* channel. The name of this channel uses the following format: 				

  rhel-x86_64-variant-optional-6

Replace _variant_ with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system variant (server or workstation). 			
	
### 2.2 Subscribe the system to the channels from step no. 1 by running the following command as root: 

  rhn-channel --add --channel=channel_name

Replace _channel_name_ with the name of the channel to enable. 				

### 2.3. To verify the list of channels you are subscribed to, at any time, run as root: 				

  rhn-channel --list

Once the system is subscribed, you can install Red Hat Developer Toolset as described in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Install.html[Section 1.5, “Installing Red Hat Developer Toolset”]. For more information on how to register your system with RHN Classic, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/[Red Hat Subscription Management] collection of guides. 

# 2. Installing Red Hat Developer Toolset (10 minutes)

This section is an abridged version from our  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Install.html[Developer Guide: Installing Red Hat Developer Toolset]

Red Hat Developer Toolset is distributed as a collection of RPM packages that can be installed, updated, uninstalled, and inspected by using the standard package management tools that are included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Note that a valid subscription that provides access to the Red Hat Software Collections content set is required in order to install Red Hat Developer Toolset on your system. For detailed instructions on how to associate your system with an appropriate subscription and get access to Red Hat Developer Toolset, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Subscribe.html[Section 1.4, “Getting Access to Red Hat Developer Toolset”.]

*Important* Before installing Red Hat Developer Toolset, install all available Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates. 		

## ⁠2.1. Installing All or Some DTS Components

To install *all DTS components* (see the table below) that are included in Red Hat Developer Toolset, install the devtoolset-3 package by typing the following at a shell prompt as 'root': 		

  yum install devtoolset-3

.Table DTS components by package
|===
|Package Name|Description|Installed Components

|devtoolset-3-ide
|Integrated Development Environment
|Eclipse

|devtoolset-3-perftools
|Performance monitoring tools
|SystemTap, Valgrind, OProfile, Dyninst

|devtoolset-3-toolchain
|Development and debugging tools
|GCC, GDB, binutils, elfutils, dwz, memstomp, strace, ltrace
|===

To install any of these meta packages individually, type the following at a shell prompt as 'root':

  yum install package_name

Replace package_name with a space-separated list of meta packages you want to install. For example, to install only the Eclipse development environment and packages that depend on it, type as 'root':	
	
  ~]# yum install devtoolset-3-ide

### ⁠2.1.1. Installing Optional Packages

Red Hat Developer Toolset is distributed with a number of optional packages that are not installed by default. To list all Red Hat Developer Toolset packages that are available to you but not installed on your system, type the following command at a shell prompt: 		

  yum list available devtoolset-3-\*

To install any of these optional packages, run as root: 
	
  yum install package_name

Replace package_name with a space-separated list of packages that you want to install. For example, to install the devtoolset-3-gdb-gdbserver and devtoolset-3-gdb-doc packages, type: 		

  ~]# yum install devtoolset-3-gdb-gdbserver devtoolset-3-gdb-doc

### 2.1.2 Installing Debugging Information

To install debugging information for any of the Red Hat Developer Toolset packages, make sure that the yum-utils package is installed and run the following command as root: 		

  debuginfo-install package_name

For example, to install debugging information for the devtoolset-3-dwz package, type: 		

  ~]# debuginfo-install devtoolset-3-dwz

Note that in order to use this command, you need to have access to the repository with these packages. If your system is registered with Red Hat Subscription Management, enable the rhel-variant-rhscl-version-debug-rpms repository as described in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Subscribe.html#sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Subscribe-RHSM[Section 1.4.1, “Using Red Hat Subscription Management”]. If your system is registered with RHN Classic, subscribe the system to the rhel-x86_64-variant-version-debuginfo channel as described in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/3/html/User_Guide/sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Subscribe.html#sect-Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset-Subscribe-RHN_Classic[Section 1.4.2, “Using RHN Classic”]. For more information on how to get access to debuginfo packages, see https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/9907[https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/9907]. 		

## 2.2 Using Red Hat Developer Toolset Container Images

Starting with Red Hat Developer Toolset 3.1, Dockerfiles are available for selected Red Hat Developer Toolset components. Dockerfiles are text documents that contain instructions for automated building of docker-formatted container images. The resulting container images can be used to run Red Hat Developer Toolset components inside virtual software containers, thus isolating them from the host system and allowing for their rapid deployment. This section describes how to obtain Red Hat Developer Toolset Dockerfiles, how to use them to build docker-formatted container images, and how to run Red Hat Developer Toolset components using the resulting container images. 

Red Hat Developer Toolset 3.1 is shipped with the following Dockerfiles: 	
* devtoolset-3-dyninst 			
* devtoolset-3-elfutils 			
* devtoolset-3-oprofile 			
* devtoolset-3-systemtap (only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) 			
* devtoolset-3-toolchain 			
* devtoolset-3-valgrind 			
* devtoolset-3 (only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) 			

*Note.* The docker package, which contains the *Docker* daemon, command line tool, and other necessary components for building and using docker-formatted container images, is currently only available for the Server variant of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 product. Red Hat Developer Toolset Dockerfiles are distributed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as well, but the images built using them can only be deployed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server. 	

### 2.2.1. Obtaining Dockerfiles

The Red Hat Developer Toolset Dockerfiles are provided by the devtoolset-3-dockerfiles package. The package contains individual Dockerfiles for building docker-formatted container images with individual components and a meta-package for building a docker-formatted container image with all the components offered. To be able to use the Dockerfiles, install this package by executing: 
	
  ~]# yum install devtoolset-3-dockerfiles

Note that because some Red Hat Developer Toolset components depend on packages from the Optional channel, the provided Dockerfiles contain instructions that enable the channel automatically. 	

### 2.2.2. Building Container Images

Follow the instruction outlined at https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker in RHEL 7] to set up an environment for building and using docker-formatted container images. 		

When you are ready to build your image, change to the directory where the Dockerfile is installed and run the docker build command as shown in the following example. 		
⁠
### Example 1 -  Building a Container Image with a Red Hat Developer Toolset Component

To build a docker-formatted container image for deploying the elfutils tools in a container, follow the instructions below.  Type the following at a shell prompt as 'root'.

Make sure you have a *Docker* environment set up properly on your system by following instructions at https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893#get[Getting Docker in RHEL 7].
			
Install the package containing the Red Hat Developer Toolset Dockerfiles: 					

  ~]# yum install devtoolset-3-dockerfiles

Determine where the Dockerfile for the required component is located: 					

  ~]# rpm -ql devtoolset-3-dockerfiles | grep "elfutils/Dockerfile"

Change to the directory where the required Dockerfile is installed: 	

  ~]# cd /opt/rh/devtoolset-3/root/usr/share/devtoolset-3-dockerfiles/rhel7/devtoolset-3-elfutils/

Build the container image using the docker build command: 					

  ~]# docker build -t devtoolset-3-elfutils-7 .

Replace ‘devtoolset-3-elfutils-7’ with the name you wish to assign to your resulting container image. 					

### 2.2.3. Running Red Hat Developer Toolset Tools from Container Images

To launch the docker-formatted container image you built above in Example 1, execute the docker run command as follows: 		

  docker run -t -i container-image /bin/bash -l

Substitute the _container-image_ parameter with the name of the container image you chose when building it. So for Example 1 above, run the following command: 	
	
  ~]# docker run -t -i devtoolset-3-elfutils-7 /bin/bash -l




#  3. Build your first application (10 minutes)

## Tutorial: Creating a simple C++ application with Eclipse IDE

http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Fgetting_started%2Fcdt_w_basic.htm[In this tutorial], you will use the Eclipse CDT to create a simple 'Hello World' application. This tutorial describes the process of creating a new C++ project where the build is automatically managed by the CDT, and running the program.

NOTE: In earlier versions of the CDT, there were two separate project types: Managed make (automatically generated a makefile) and Standard make (required the user's makefile to build). Now with CDT, you just select a project type, and that determines what build system to use.

To create a simple "Hello World" application using CDT, perform the following general steps:
