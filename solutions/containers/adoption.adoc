*New to containers?* +
Begin with this handy Red Hat guide: https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems].

== Developing for containers

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/blog/introducing-red-hat-container-development-kit-2-beta[Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK)] is a pre-built container development environment based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to help you get started developing container-based applications quickly. The containers you build can be easily deployed on any Red Hat container host or platform, including: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, and our platform-as-a-service solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3.

=== Get started with containers on Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, or Linux

To save you from having to assemble a container development environment from scratch, CDK delivers the latest container tools in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine that you can use on your link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_mac_os_x[Mac OS X], link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_microsoft_windows[Microsoft Windows], link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#installing_the_cdk_on_fedora_or_red_hat_enterprise_linux[RHEL or Fedora Linux system]. In addition, you have your choice of virtualization platforms (VirtualBox, VMware, and the Linux KVM/libvirt hypervisors are all supported). All of the VM configuration details on your system are handled for you by Vagrant, an open-source tool for creating and distributing portable and reproducible development environments.

Red Hat Container Development Kit 2 beta is available now to customers and partners with link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer subscriptions] and to partners who join the link:https://connect.redhat.com/zones/containers[Container Zone via the Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners program]. To learn how to install the Red Hat CDK, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/[Red Hat CDK Installation Guide]. 

=== Something for all levels of container experience

The CDK is for you whether you are trying Docker-formatted containers for the first time, or want to see the latest developments in container tools from Red Hat.  If you are just getting started, try some container examples from the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-container-development-kit/[Getting Started with Container Development Kit] guide.

If you are ready to try scaling out and orchestrating multi-container deployments, CDK has OpenShift Enterprise 3 and Kubernetes installed. You can choose between multi-container environments that are managed by OpenShift Enterprise or by just Kubernetes itself.

=== Want to try OpenShift Enterprise 3 Platform-as-a-Service?

The CDK provides a prebuilt, single-machine OpenShift Enterprise 3 environment, so you can try the latest version of the OpenShift platform-as-a-service that integrates support for docker-formatted containers and Kubernetes. When you bring up the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#choosing_a_cdk_vagrantfile[rhel-ose Vagrantfile], OpenShift is started and provisioned.

To help you get started building applications, a number of OpenShift templates are included. You can access the OpenShift Web console from your browser or work from the CLI using the oc command to deploy container applications. OpenShift is pre-configured with a local Docker registry available and a local version of Kubernetes running, so you can test the full experience in a self contained environment.

=== Orchestrate applications using Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an orchestration and management platform for automatic deployment, scaling and operation of application containers on a cluster of machines. Deploying containers using Kubernetes requires metadata information in the form of artifacts files. So a developer needs a simple setup of Kubernetes to be able to test application containers and the artifacts before moving the deployment to other environments, such as testing and production environments.

The CDK provides a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-installation-guide/#choosing_a_cdk_vagrantfile[rhel-k8s-singlenode-setup Vagrantfile] that can start up a single node Kubernetes configuration (a single master and node setup) on the same host just with a "vagrant up" command. A developer could then use the kubectl command to create pods, services, replication controllers and other elements to manage and scale containerized applications.

=== Convert VM images to Containers with v2c

Virtual-to-Container (v2c) is a tool for importing and converting disk images (like virtual machine images) into docker-formatted container images, complete with the appropriate metadata. The v2c tool makes it simple to take a working VM that has a single application and generate a dockerfile that runs the same application in a container.

A typical v2c user is an organization with an existing collection of VM images that embed significant organization-specific software or configuration.  The resulting base images provide a starting point that you can build on with additional dockerfile(s) and configuration.

If you would like to try this capability out please reach out to us on the mailing list supplied below.

=== Atomic App and the Nulecule Specification

Those interested in the evolution of container tooling will want to try Atomic App, which is Red Hat’s reference implementation of the Nulecule specification. The Nulecule specification enables complex containerized applications to be defined, packaged and distributed using standard container technologies. The resulting container includes dependencies, supports multiple orchestration providers, and has the ability to specify resource requirements. The Nulecule specification also supports the aggregation of multiple composite applications.

For a preview of Atomic App, see this blog post: link:http://dustymabe.com/2016/01/18/running-nulecules-in-openshift-via-oc-new-app/[Running Nulecules in OpenShift via oc new-app].

==== Containerizing with JBoss

*JBoss Projects and Docker* +
We publish our images under the official https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/jboss/[jboss organization]. Every image is built from Dockerfiles available from the repositories in our https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles[GitHub organization]. Images are linked to each other: If an image we’re base on is modified, we rebuild our image to provide you the fresh image that you deserve.

In this session, and right after an introduction to Docker, Marek will dive into examples showing how you can leverage this tool to create a deployment environment for your applications. You will see how to cluster JBoss EAP and deploy an application to it. Marek will share some tips and tricks too: for example how to manage logs or customize the configuration of JBoss EAP to be able to deploy your applications.

=== Containers support modern application development trends
A recent Forrester Consulting study asked IT decision-makers "For which workloads or application use cases have you used/do you anticipate to use containers?"

=== Security - How to keep your containers safe and certified

[.large-24.columns.containers-callout]
*Survey:* +
*53% say security is their biggest concern about containers.*

You must make sure that container images running in your infrastructure are safe to consume and certified to run wherever they are deployed.

* Opensource.com: http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux[Containers don't contain]. Containers only improve the isolation of applications so treat privileged processes inside a container the same way you'd treat them outside of it.
