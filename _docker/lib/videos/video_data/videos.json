We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of Things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we're ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.\n\n== Speaker ==\nMartyn Taylor is a senior software engineer at Red Hat, with over 7 years' experience working on cloud, middleware and messaging software.

Consequently, it will be possible to manage the balancer with the same tools that are used to manage the rest of the domain. What is more, users will be able to use more efficient protocols, such as HTTP/2, for communication between the balancer and backend servers.\nAn OpenShift cartdridge, which will enable users to use WildFly 9 in cloud environment, will be provided.\nWildFly 9 will use OpenJDK ORB library instead of JacORB.</p>",

    "title": "Docker and JBoss - the perfect combination",
    "description": "<p>For this session we have Marek Goldmann who leads Docker related initiatives at Red Hat. \n\nAbstract\n\nDocker is a tool for building portable Linux containers around an application. If you are unfamiliar with Docker, or have heard of it but never used it, then you should definitely come to this session because containers are the new virtualization.\n\nDocker is a revolution in thinking about software distribution. It makes the process of creating images with the whole application stack (OS + application server + application itself) easy and extremely fast. You can share them easily too, and images behave the same way on different machines. Differences between development and production environments are a thing of the past. But that's not everything - Docker helps you run images too by providing an easy to use interface. Sounds like magic, huh?\n\nIn this session, right after introduction to Docker, Marek will dive into examples showing how you can leverage this tool to create a deployment environment for your applications. You will see how to cluster JBoss EAP and deploy an application to it. Marek will share some tips and tricks too: for example how to manage logs or customize the configuration of JBoss EAP to be able to deploy your applications.\n\n\n\nAbout Marek\n\nMarek joined Red Hat in January 2009 and started hacking on Cloud-related JBoss projects. Currently Marek leads the WildFly integration effort with the Fedora operating system, and makes sure that JBoss' projects run well on Docker.</p>",

    "title": "Transactions in the Cloud",
    "description": "<p>For this meetup we have two short talks, both with a \"Transactions in the Cloud\" theme. The talks cover some novel research undertaken by this summer's intern students.\n\n\nTransactions and NoSQL Review\n\nIt is a common to forgo the use of transactions in an application due to untested performance or scalability concerns. While it is true that transactions do come at a cost, they also bring a lot of strong guarantees essential to a correctly running application. There are many differing transaction options available, each with varying costs and guarantees. Rather than dismiss transactions altogether, it would be more prudent to consider how your application would perform under a number of different transaction models and select the option that hits the right balance of performance and guarantees. \n\nThis presentation provides a useful reference for developers and architects who need the guarantees that transactions can bring, but don't know which model is right for them. In particular the presentation will:\n\n\n1) Review each of the transaction options available in NoSQL today.\n\n2) Compare ACID and Extended (relaxed ACID) transaction models and understand how these models relate to NoSQL and scalability.\n\n3) Present performance results for a selection of transaction options under different classes of workload. Covering a single node, as well as cluster of sharded nodes.\n\n\nScaling a transaction manager in the Cloud\n\nTransaction coordination systems such as Narayana rely upon storage facilities to recreate transaction state during recovery from a system crash. These logs are usually stored on RAID hard drives to maximize reliability. However, any disk I/O is relatively slow and writing the logs can become a bottleneck in high performance transaction systems. Using the fastest available disk subsystems is thus an expensive necessity for many enterprise applications.\n\nThe use of a cluster of inexpensive, unreliable hardware nodes in conjunction with data replication for redundancy is an increasingly popular and cost effective architecture for many highly scalable, high reliability applications. Data grids such as Infinispan provides distributed in-memory replication of Java objects, making programming for this kind of cluster relatively simple.\n\nThis presentation will cover a new transaction logging plugin for Narayana that uses a data grid to replicate the logs to main memory on other nodes in a cluster, in preference to writing them to disk. In addition, the presentation will also cover performance benchmarks and reliability trade-offs.</p>",

Problems can still arise, however, for example poor transactional throughput may manifest when a high volume of transactions rollback, which can have a myriad of non obvious causes.\n\nThis talk will explore the current methods of troubleshooting some common transactional issues using JBoss and introduce TxVis: a prototype transaction profiling and visualisation tool. We will discuss the challenges of its development and how it will aid the user in profiling the performance of transactions in their software and quickly isolate some commonly occurring problems.</p>",

In the Mesos’ model, application frameworks are responsible for scheduling and deployment logic. Multiple frameworks can be run on bare metal at the same time, using a single pool of resources, including use cases for long-running services (including Marathon, Aurora, Singularity) and batch or streaming (Hadoop, Storm, Jenkins).\n\nSeveral IaaS projects, including OpenStack and CloudStack, are interested in the abstraction Mesos provides for running and writing distributed applications. While IaaS typically addresses a larger set of concerns, the narrow focus of Mesos on resource management provides opportunities for integration between traditional IaaS and Mesos in the future.\n\nIn this session, you’ll get you an overview of the Mesos compute model, see how it relates to Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and walk through writing an application for Mesos using the framework API.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Project Atomic’s evolving Nulecule [pronounced: noo-le-kyul] specification is an attempt to move beyond the current limitations of the container model. Docker introduced the concept of portability with aggregate application packaging to the container space.\n\nThe Docker packaging format stops at the individual container. And even the ‘pods’ concept introduced by Kubernetes and picked up by rkt does not address multi-container applications in their entirety.\n\nNulecule defines a pattern for packaging multi-container applications with all their dependencies and orchestration metadata in a container image. This enables the in-band transport of this application-level information using the same transport mechanism used for the component containers. It also defines an interaction model allowing parameter management of  standard software for deployment as well as the aggregation of multiple, complex, container-based applications into higher-level applications.\n\nThe Atomic App is an implementation of that spec for the Red Hat product  universe using Docker and Kubernetes to implement the packaging format,  transport, application description, and orchestration interface.\n\nThis talk will take you through the creation (structure, build) and deployment (transport and configuration) of an Atomic App.</p>",

Or, you don't run your code at all until you can hit a test or QA back-end service and hope everything works. Either way, there's a lot of hoping and not a lot of productive functional testing.\n\nIt’s becoming more reasonable to have an instance of your application in a shared environment with other services hosted inside a modern cloud platform.

It explains how to replicate the environment for development, testing, staging, and production minimizing the impedance mismatch between them. A quick overview of Arquillian and how it helps in a automated testing across multiple Java EE containers is shown. How functional testing, code coverage, performance and other aspects for going in to production will be discussed. Using Arquillian against Docker containers will be explained as well. Finally, configuring Jenkins for Continuous Integration and setting up deployment pipelines will show how to take an application from push-to-production and achieve almost 100% automation.</p>",

Design decisions made too early are just speculations without facts. But you must have architecture in place before you can do anything. This session talks about the tension between architecture & design in agile projects, discussing two key elements of emergent design (utilizing the last responsible moment and harvesting idiomatic patterns) and how to de-brittlize your architecture, so that you can play nicely with others. This talk includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing design to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping your code in sync with the problem domain.</p>",

This system has previously been described as \"dream devops\". In our data centers we had monolithic systems and centralized operations. When we moved to the cloud we fully embraced the distributed services and the devops model. Now, with experience, we've uncovered real-world challenges with the devops model and, as a result, have embraced more effective hybrid approaches. More specifically, how do we reconcile local agility and ownership with the achievement of system-wide objectives, such as the overall quality and reliability of large scale distributed environment? Topics will include our software lifecycle from code checkin to automated machine image baking to deployment, monitoring and alerting, and how Netflix uses self service tools to enable our developers to maintain maximum code velocity.</p>",

On the storage front, we're seeing the emergence of many alternative Hadoop-compatible file systems. Red Hat has built an interface layer for its Red Hat Storage Server product. This complete implementation of the Hadoop file system interface lets Hadoop-related projects run transparently, directly on a Red Hat Storage Server cluster.\n\nThis talk will concentrate on contrasting the architectures of the HDFS against alternate Hadoop file systems—focused primarily on GlusterFS (the underlying technology for Red Hat Storage Server), but also examining implementations done on top of NoSQL and object storage. We'll talk about:\n\n* The current implementation.\n* What we've learned about compatibility, performance, and scalability.\n* The roadmap for next-generation implementations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Properly freeing external resources such as files and connections in a garbage collected environment requires care. The JVM's finalize() and PhantomReference features provide APIs and JVM targetted languages a way to handle the common case of a forgotten close. Unfortunately these capabilities are deeply flawed, and require specialized techniques to use correctly. This session will dive deeply into the problem, showing how the JVM can get it wrong. It will offer useful tips on how developers can safely manage their resources, and never forgot to close. In addition, API and language designers will gain more insight into the inner-workings of the JVM, and how they can safely avoid the peril of JVM finalization.</p>",

    "description": "<p>MongoDB and similar document-based NoSQL datastores tend to offer limited transaction support. And with good reason, as using an ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction to make updates to multiple documents (potentially over multiple resources) can limit scalability.\n\nBut there are alternative transaction models that can be used in favor of removing transactions altogether. In this presentation, you'll see:\n\n* How to use a compensating-transaction approach to provide many of the ACID guarantees without the scalability limitations that an ACID approach could bring.\n* Cases in which ACID transactions might not be appropriate—in particular, why ACID transaction support for multiple document updates is rarely offered in a NoSQL datastore.\n* How to use a compensating transaction as an alternative.\n* How to develop applications that make transactional updates to multiple documents in a MongoDB datastore.\n* How reliability can be built upon the primitives provided by MongoDB and how the middleware can abstract this from the developer.\n\nThe majority of this talk will include a code example that uses the Narayana compensating-transactions API, which greatly simplifies the development of applications that need this transaction model.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Hadoop has brought distributed data platforms to the masses, disrupting decades of data storage and processing practices with scalable platforms built on commodity components, conquering the problem of large scale batch processing such as ETL. But solving problems beyond batch on Hadoop has been a challenge from the beginning, and nobody has ever accused Hadoop of being all that easy to use, leading to a plethora of bolt-on tools. Whether trying to write applications using an API that's easy to reason, constructing multi-stage data processing pipelines, processing high throughput streams, delivering interactive experiences to users, processing SQL, or simply trying to take advantage of all the memory on the cluster, the typical Hadoop deployment has become a complex array of somewhat interoperable moving parts.\n\nApache Spark is rapidly becoming the tool of choice to solve a number of these problems with a single framework for fast in-memory computing, and with the second largest community of active developers in Big Data (trailing only Apache Hadoop MapReduce), you can expect it to continue to thrive. Spark has an easy to use API (available in several different languages), shells for interactive analysis, a broad range of libraries from graph processing to machine learning, is compatible with Hadoop-stored data, and can run on Hadoop 2's YARN resource manager or in stand-alone environments. Come learn how you can get started writing Spark applications in just a few easy steps, and bring the power of Spark to your big data platform.</p>",

This can lead to frustration as you try to find tools and command-line options to collect the desired performance-monitoring data.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn recipes (sets of steps) to collect desired performance information to diagnose common performance issues. The recipes provide a starting point for performance analysis and can be adjusted to suit local needs. Example recipes include:\n\n* Determine what code is consuming processor time.\n* Determine where interpreted code (Java, Python, and Ruby) consumes processor time.\n* Determine what code is consuming memory.\n* Determine whether an application is using processor cache memory effectively.\n* Determine which applications are producing network traffic.\nMeasure the latency of disk and network operations.</p>",

JRebel is a tool that tackles the challenge of live application update for the Java EE platform.\n\nWith live code reloading, JRebel ensures that the developer can quickly alternate between the developing environment and the web browser, thereby reducing wasted time and increasing the productivity flow.\n\nThis talk will feature a number of conceptual and technical challenges that JRebel's creators discovered while building the tool. Join us to learn how:\n\n* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) wasn't designed for live updates, but the JRebel engine mitigates the problem.\n* The diversity of the Java ecosystem—the variety of application servers, frameworks, and tools—makes it challenging to create a generic solution that would fit the majority of developers. The Java platform itself allows us to develop a solution by applying bytecode instrumentation mechanism.</p>",

    "description": "<p>CDI portable extensions are among the greatest features of Java EE, enabling the platform to be extended in a clean and portable way. But allowing extension is just part of the story. CDI opens the door to a whole new ecosystem for Java EE, but it’s not the role of the specification to create these extensions. Apache DeltaSpike is the project that leads this brand new ecosystem by providing useful extension modules for CDI applications as well as tools to ease the creation of new ones. This session starts by presenting the DeltaSpike toolbox and shows how it helps you develop for CDI. Then it describes the major extensions included in DeltaSpike, including “configuration,” “scheduling,” and “data.”</p>",

    "description": "<p>Modern machines have more memory and more processors than ever. Service-level agreement (SLA) applications guarantee response times of 10 to 500 milliseconds. To meet the lower end of that goal, we need garbage collection algorithms that are efficient enough to enable programs to run in the available memory but also optimized to never interrupt the running program for more than a handful of milliseconds. Shenandoah is an open source low-pause-time collector for OpenJDK designed to meet those goals. Learn more in this session.</p>",

Do these technologies bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder, or maybe the contrary? Do they actually help us write better tests more easily? This session explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also how the new world can help us test better. It takes a close look at various topics, from NodeJS-, DynJS-, VertX-, Ceylon-, or Ruby-orchestrated microservices through system-scale testing with various configurations to database migration and regression testing. All are within reach.</p>",

However, it wasn’t until Java EE 5, in 2006, that extensions were really talked about. In Java EE 5, we received Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Along with the namesake of the specification, extensions were introduced. Together we have the ability to extend the platform to do whatever we need. The possibilities of these extensions are limited only by your imagination. You’ve heard about CDI and the extensibility of Java EE 6 and seen enough to pique your curiosity. This session will sate that curiosity and give you enough information to build great extensions for your application and business.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Containers are enabling developers to package their applications in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere: on your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud. This lab offers developers an intro-level hands-on session with Docker, from installation to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OS X, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Even the simplest application ideas always end up requiring more development than you hoped for: maintaining long-lived state, interaction with other services or human actors performing some of the work, showing current status of ongoing requests, management and reporting, etc. Business processes and rules allow you to externalize some of that logic and dynamically update it, but you don't want your business process management (BPM) system to get in your way either. And every application is different, so you want to be able to fully control every bit of it. Using process-driven application development, you define your application logic in a (flexible) business process, but you also expect your BPM system to help you out with much more than that. In this session we will show you live how to quickly get new web applications up and running by relying on jBPM to provide some of the UI (should you want to), or even to generate parts of your application for you (that you can customize later), so you can focus on what makes your application different. jBPM uses the power of open source and it's flexible architecture to let you decide what you need: nothing more, nothing less.</p>",

    "title": "From object oriented to functional domain modeling by Mario Fusco",
    "description": "<p>Join us in March 21-23 for Devoxx US 2017, details @ https://devoxx.us \n\nThe main consequence of the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8 is the possibility of conveniently mixing the object oriented and the functional paradigms. Nevertheless the biggest part of Java developers is not used yet to employ functional idioms and then they are not ready to fully leverage the new functional capabilities of Java. In particular it is still uncommon to see functions used together with data in business domain model. The purpose of this talk is not doing a comparison between object oriented and functional programming, but showing how these two styles can be combined in order to take advantage of the good parts of both. For example it's usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to a inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect free code allows better reusability. This talk will demonstrate the validity of these statements with practical examples till to distil the essence of functional programming: data and behaviours are two aspects of the same thing.</p>",

Maven poms can be written in a beautiful Ruby DSL. Swing, JavaFX, and other graphics libraries become easy and fun with JRuby. Sass and Asciidoctor are already being used in Java apps thanks to JRuby. And you can bundle up the whole thing in an executable jar or war file; your devops will never know it's Ruby. Come see what JRuby 9000 can do for you in 2015.</p>",

Should we adopt PaaS, is a container eco-system the right approach? Sadly if you currently have any legacy software or infrastructure you will soon find that these are not the hard questions you need to answer. Adopting continuous delivery practices requires change that includes organizational structure, processes and architecture. You cannot tackle one without the other as Conway's Law states they are inherently intertwined. So how do you create an organizational culture, methodology and architecture that supports rapid delivery of software, whilst still keeping your legacy systems up and running? How do you avoid common pitfalls or anti-patterns, which will hinder your ability to deliver? In this talk, I will address patterns such as micro-services, evolutionary architecture and empowered x-functional teams, which can speed up your delivery, but are not a free lunch. And how you move from your current monolith to adoption of these patterns.</p>",

In this session, we'll look at changes to both the workbench and the core engine—what's available now and what's in the roadmap. The 7.x workbench has had a big usability revamp with improved advanced editors and automated deployments to the execution server. We'll look at a 'low code' example to see the authoring, deployment, and usage of decision service. This example will integrate the new forms and application directory functionality. The workbench is now highly customizable and we'll demonstrate how to add new custom editors and the mash up capability of the workbench to easily add new pages and components for your domain. The 7.x engine delivers a new hybrid reasoning capability to make it much easier to work reactively with nested objects, providing a new XPath inspired notation for list comprehension, making things much more natural for Java developers. And it now has a pluggable layer for different knowledge types, and we'll discuss and demonstrate how to integrate another subsystem such as a Bayesian Network. We'll also demonstrate the new capabilities for default and exception rules and cover pojo-rules that make use of Java 8 lambda for rules in pure Java.</p>",

In this session, we'll look at the modular approach used to build reusable Javascript modules in the Red Hat mobile field workforce management application (WFM) showcased in this year's Summit middleware keynote demo. Reusable modules for WFM are packaged as node package manager (npm) modules, providing a consistent format for both server and client sides using Node.js and Browserify. Modules are loosely coupled using the Mediator pattern and they broadcast user actions and state changes giving the application and other modules the opportunity to hook into those events. Additionally, visual components are packaged in a framework-agnostic manner, providing reusable UI components. You'll leave this session understanding the challenges faced when building reusable modules for large-scale applications, and the solutions employed in building out the reusable WFM modules.</p>",

This session introduces Eclipse Che and shows how a cloud IDE can make developing Java projects fast and powerful. We'll compare Intellisense, content assist, machines, plug-in architecture, and performance when compared to traditional desktop IDEs. Che includes numerous forms of refactoring and uses Docker to initiate environments and machines to build and run code. We'll also cover Maven, Ant, and Gradle extensions and discusses how Che can be extended with custom code templates, Dockerfiles, and plug-ins (authored in Java, of course). Additionally, Che has a Kubernetes and OpenShift plug-in, which provides duality of environments between development and production, all structured on container topologies. We'll discuss how developers are marrying their code with containers and keeping those topologies synchronized between different environments, and the role that IDEs must play in this world.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As application systems move to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments and every source code change results in a full build, a simple change can easily take minutes. This is much longer than developers are willing to wait to verify a change. And working in the cloud shouldn't mean loss of control and visibility into how an application is working. In this session, we'll cover how OpenShift by Red Hat works closely with Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to let you push code directly to a container, see your changes as you make them, debug live in deployment, and much more.</p>",

Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we’re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.</p>",

In this session, we'll look at an extension to Thermostat that allows it to capture and present arbitrary application-specific data in a variety of different formats. By integrating Thermostat with Byteman, a tool that easily injects Java code almost anywhere in a running Java application, the Byteman-Thermostat integration package can gather simple data or statistics and pass them to the Thermostat back end. The back end automatically displays it in a suitable graphical format alongisde all other monitored statistics. Byteman supports un-injection and re-injection of code, making it possible to gather ad hoc statistics and tune in to specific, problematic behaviors. We'll mostly proceed by demonstrating Byteman and Thermostat in action—showing how to set up and run Thermostat with Byteman in place and providing examples of how to gather several interesting application-specific statistics from a sample Java deployment.</p>",

Agile, DevOps, and Lean are all frameworks to help us be better developers and write better systems, but it still seems to be a constant struggle. Commander Chris Hadfield is a bona fide astronaut, test pilot, and rocket scientist, and he commanded the International Space Station for 3 months, making waves back on earth with his cover of Bowie’s Space Oddity. On returning, he wrote a book about everything he learned on his journey to becoming an astronaut. You’d be surprised by how much of it applies to application development. Application development should be easy—it ain't rocket science. In this session, you'll learn: - How Russia represents DevOps and Lean development, while America represents the waterfall method - How to create robust systems by thinking, “What could kill me next?” - How astronauts make amazing teams, and how to apply that in our own environments.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Delivering an app or service fast and frequently to production isn't the same as delivering the app or service fast and frequently to its intended users. Before an app is actually 'live' it has to run the gauntlet of production deployment that stands between it and real, live users. While DevOps has helped organizations make huge strides toward continuous delivery in dev and test environments, the production environment remains a very real obstacle in realizing continuous deployment. The biggest hurdle in that obstacle course is a narrow definition of DevOps that fails to include a broad set of technologies and tools outside the Dev and Ops domain. In this session we'll explore the underlying elements of a comprehensive DevOps approach (SDN, CD/CI, and Agile) and how they mix, match, and combine to enable the operational transformation DevOps promises to achieve the ultimate goal of IT agility: continuous deployment.</p>",

Thanks to near caching, JBoss Data Grid offers excellent response times for data queried regularly, and its continuous remote event support means data can get pushed from the data grid to the Node.js application instead of having to wait for the data grid to serve it. In this session, we'll show how to build Node.js applications that use JBoss Data Grid as a persistence layer.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The main consequence of the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8 is the possibility of conveniently mixing the object-oriented and the functional paradigms. It's still uncommon to see functions used together with data in the business domain model. For example, it's usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to an inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect-free code allows better reusability. In this session, we're: -- Not going to compare object-oriented and functional programming -- Are going to show how the two styles can be combined to take advantage of the good parts of each -- Going to look at practical examples to distill the essence of functional programming</p>",

Most of the time, we don't care which algorithms—SHA-256 or SHA-512, RSA or ECC, AES-128 or AES-256, padding schemes, iteration number, key sizes—are or aren't ideal for encryption, or if a poor choice could benefit attackers. In this technical session, we won't use complex math, and most of the concepts will be illustrated with source code, as we explore: - Broken cryptography - Libraries available for development - Hashing passwords and what people have been doing wrong - Usage of digital signatures - Protecting local data - How to properly exchange encryption keys - Securely sending data over the network - Preventing illegal tampering on client/server applications - SSL best practices - Cryptography in our daily basis</p>",

In this session, we'll look at how fabric8, which runs on top of OpenShift 3 by Red Hat and Kubernetes, uses Docker and Jenkins workflow for pipeline orchestration to provide an extensible OOTB CD solution. Fabric8 significantly simplifies the creation of new projects with a one-click setup and the wiring-together of tooling such and version control systems, artifact repositories, and release pipelines. With human approval, automated integration testing, ChatOps, environment + pipeline visualisation, commit traceability, and a developer experience that helps teams deliver value faster, we'll see how the strength of the open source community works together to provide a consistent approach to building and releasing software for new, cloud-based microservices.</p>",

In large part, industry trends seem to indicate that the sloganization of the word has done a significant disservice to the ideas that were originally founded in 2001. To add even more pain, most people seem to be entirely unaware of the core basis of Agile which is the idea to embrace change but inspect and adapt to that change. Are we lost as an industry? Is there anyway we can recover from this problem? In this session, attendees can expect to engage in a conversation about the rise of the Agile community, the negative and positive impact it has had on the industry, and how you individually can help your organizations and teams lower the risk of encountering the negative problems, and speed your way towards the positives. Topics will include: - The intentions behind agile - Ways you can rework or improve your not so great agile situation - Things you should avoid from the start.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Programmers use a simple sequential model of how a processor executes steps in a program, but in reality the processor's implementation is much more complex. The processor employs techniques that exploit typical characteristics of the code allowing the processor to execute the code much faster than the simple programmer's model and reduce the cost of some individual instructions by a factor of ten to one-hundred. However, the processor must preserve the behavior that the programmer expects and fallback to the slower methods when the optimization would yield results that differ from the programmer's model. Mechanisms such as caches, pipelines, branch prediction, and threading are commonly used in modern processors to improve performance. In this session, we'll explain the performance implications of these mechanisms, how to identify specific performance issues such as poor caching and branch prediction using the tools available on Linux and some optimization techniques that better match code and hardware capabilities.</p>",

    "description": "<p>You've been hearing about microservices for months and have probably taken a look at 12-factor and cloud-native apps, too. But there's a myriad of frameworks and tools you can use to craft your software and join the pieces together into a microservices architecture. You want to use the best tool for the job, and you need a hassle-free DevOps pipeline to orchestrate and deploy all of them. In this session, you'll learn how to combine a lot of different technologies and tools in a live demo that will open your eyes to the huge possibilities that microservices can help you achieve. We'll have it all: containers, Docker, Wildfly Swarm, Spring Boot, NodeJS, .NET, OpenShift, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and more.</p>",

In this session, we'll walk you through using Docker and discuss why using a scheduler and orchestration system is important. Then we'll dive into an actual usage of the container application platform, OpenShift Enterprise 3 by Red Hat, to show how it makes both Docker and Kubernetes accessible to the average human being. We'll keep the slides to a minimum and instead focus on live demo/coding/deployments. After deploying several containers, we'll turn up the heat by showcasing scaling and moving on to deployment strategies including blue/green.</p>",

For this scenario, we need something more. For that “more,” we have Kubernetes by Google, a container platform based on the same technology used to deploy billions of containers per month on Google’s infrastructure. Ready to leverage your Docker skills and package your current Java app (WAR, EAR, or JAR)? Come to this session to see how your current Docker skill set can be easily mapped to Kubernetes concepts and commands. And get ready to deploy your containers in production.</p>",

Even if this scales better and enables individual release schedules per services it also leads to more data silos.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Hibernate OGM explores how to map the Java Persistence APIs with various underlying NoSQL stores. While NoSQL datastores offer interesting benefits in the BigData world we enter, choosing the right one for your project can be challenging. Abstracting behind JPA relieves you from the programming API/model shift. But is it possible? In this presentation, we will give an brief overview of the NoSQL landscape, describe how Hibernate OGM persists data in key/value stores, document stores, column family stores, etc. and see where using such an abstraction makes sense in applications. After this presentation, you will have a clearer view on how to integrate NoSQL datastores in your Java projects at least via JPA.\n\nPresenter: Emmanuel Bernard\n\nBio: Emmanuel Bernard is data platform architect at Red Hat JBoss Middleware and member of the Hibernate team. After graduating from Supelec (French \"Grande Ecole\"), Emmanuel has spent a few years in the retail industry as developer and architect where he started to be involved in the ORM space. He joined the Hibernate team in 2003. Emmanuel has lead the JPA implementation of Hibernate. He has founded and leads Hibernate Search, Hibernate Validator and the newcomer Hibernate OGM. Emmanuel is a member of the JPA 2.1 expert group and the spec lead of Bean Validation. He is a regular speaker at various conferences and JUGs, including JavaOne, JBoss World and Devoxx and the co-author of [Hibernate Search in Action](/books/hsia/) published by Manning. He is also founder and co-host of two podcasts: [JBoss Community Asylum](http://asylum.jboss.org) and [Les Cast Codeurs Podcast](http://lescastcodeurs.com).\n\nYou can follow him on twitter at @emmanuelbernard http://twitter.com/emmanuelbernard.</p>",

From Watson Scientific Computing Lab (established at Columbia University in 1944) to the open source contributions made in more recent decades, IBM encourages the growth of communities of innovation.\n\nShe emphasizes that IBM's longevity is not just because of profitable technology, but also their concern for fairness to employees and interest in developing technologies that are beneficial for society--including their support of open source and Linux.\n\nShe also talks about the Watson AI, IBM's involvement in the Apache Foundation, and the first IBM hypervisor (for system 360, built in 1967). That early hypervisor was just the beginning. \n\nKuznetsova discusses at length the evolution of open virtualization, the use of virtualization (like KVM), and the importance of openness in maintaining virtualization's low cost, robust behavior, and rapid rate of innovation.  She explores the market need for virtualization today, and the expectations for the technology industry of the future.\n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5</p>",

He begins with a look at the proprietary architectures of the past--expensive hardware that was difficult and expensive to manage and maintain, and hard to move away from when technologies improved.\n\nToday's technology outlook is very different. Flexible, open stacks that allow for vendor choice are replacing sunset old hardware and giving enterprise users the ability to take advantage of the newest developments.  \n\nStevens discusses the implementation of cloud technology and the open source infrastructure that runs many of the major deployments in business use today. He talks about the benefits of foundational change that are creeping in to even the most proprietary companies, and reviews some of the technical tools we use today, including Linux Torvalds' git and new Red Hat offerings like OpenShift.  Video presentations allow him to share the experiences of expert Red Hat Developer Program and product line managers, as well as partners and customers who have built their business on Red Hat. \n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5\n\nFind out more about OpenShift:\nhttp://www.openshift.com</p>",

    "description": "<p>John Newton, chief technology officer and chairman of Alfresco, speaks at the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld.\n\nNewton talks about the user's perspective on modern technologies, including cloud and virtualization. He begins by discussing the old methods of control and development in technology, controlled by large IT firms that gave customers what they needed, but not what they wanted. Though it was functional, user interfaces were often clumsy and hard to understand, and offerings were limited and expensive.\n\nAdvances in hardware and changing user demands have changed this landscape dramatically. Use of the Internet, mobile computing, and social media  has democratized and expanded, while the cost of providing these services has gone down. And people grew accustomed to these tools, and needed to bring them into the workplace.\n\nNewton describes how these emerging systems of engagement have changed the workplace IT strategy.  He touches on the benefits and dangers of these tools, and the widening audiences that can now participate in IT--even if they don't know that's what they're doing.\n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5</p>",

We will discuss how to tune connection pools and other parameters, and then tune the HTTP session clustering configuration in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (e.g., replication versus distribution).\n\nIn the next step, we will take a look at how Infinispan, which handles session clustering, can be configured to increase performance and scalability. We will then step into the basement (JGroups) and show what tuning possibilities are lurking there.\n\nAttendees will walk away with useful tips and tricks to make their JBoss Enterprise Application Platform clusters faster.

    "description": "<p>Steve Dietch, vice president of marketing for cloud solutions and infrastructure at HP, gives a talk at the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld.\n\nDietch speaks in-depth about today's popular technology--cloud. He talks about how cloud adoption has grown faster than IT departments have expected, what issues this creates, and what methods can help customers adapt.\n\nHe discusses the ways in which cloud technology can be applied--today and going forward--and how public, private, and hybrid approaches can be combined to deliver unified services that allow for a wide range of customer choice--in applications, in hypervisor, and in hardware. \n\nHe also addresses some of the concerns surrounding this rapid adoption, and how a complete, open, and integrated system can help enterprises avoid cloud sprawl and vendor lock-in, while gaining value, improving cost, and increasing performance and flexibility. \n\nDietch also talks extensively about the partnership between Red Hat and HP and the enterprise offerings they develop and support collaboratively and completely.\n \nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lew Tucker, chief technology officer for cloud at Cisco, speaks at the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld.\n\nTucker speaks about the partnership between Cisco and Red Hat, and the growing applications of software-as-a-service (SaaS) that come from this collaborative relationship.\n\nThe movement of technology to a service-oriented approach is a major shift in the industry, particularly for start-ups and smaller enterprises, who take a pay-as-you-go approach to more efficiently use their capital. But it's not just new and small companies that need the ability to flexibly and quickly handle gigantic amounts of information--every enterprise must be able to provide customers with the tools and service they now expect.  Thus, the cloud.\n\nTucker explains that cloud technologies allow customers to flexibly retain control of their software resources through economies of scale, multi-tenancy, and reliable cost reduction. He touches on Moore's Law--the idea that hardware technology will continue to advance--and discusses how this will allow us to continue to scale to meet growing demand for these services.\n\nTucker touches on the needs of specific industries, including healthcare, services, banking, and gaming, and how the new architectural models can meet and exceed these demands.</p>",

Projects like Hadoop and OpenStack create technology and standards that make it possible to move workloads and consume data where and when its needed.\n\nThe evolution of software-defined networking creates a common set of tools and templates that can apply to any system, whether it's in a public, private, or hybrid cloud. Open standards allow applications to be shared, and common tools, interfaces, and management mean that systems can work together.\n\nA best-of-breed toolset is available in OpenShift, the  cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Red Hat that includes cutting-edge resources like MongoDB and more.\n\nSystems like this--and standards like those created in projects like OpenShift--make it possible for all of us to do more with less, and use the reclaimed resources to power the next generation of innovation.\n\nWatch more 2012 Red Hat Summit and JBoss World videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL995CD1141C3330D5&feature=plcp</p>",

Improving our technology foundations and eliminating transaction costs means we can do more, and leaves admins and developers free to innovate instead of manage. \n\nEliminating transaction costs has also allowed for a boom in development--rapid iteration without the need for external investment (or approval). You no longer have to wait to debut the next big idea--it's as simple as logging into the cloud or offering your new app in the app store.\n\nThe role that standards and standards-sharing companies will play in this new information economy is critical. Open source is now mainstream, and Red Hat--a now billion-dollar company in this space--is positioned to connect communities and drive innovation for the next generation of technology. \n\nThere is no time to rest. The paradigms shift beneath our feet and we're on to the next adventure. Big data, cloud, and virtualization bring moreradical change, and the beyond-slow pace of proprietary competitors leaves Linux and open source standardization at the forefront of technology today. And Whitehurst, a self-confessed geek among other geeks at Red Hat, finds that exciting.  \n\nSee more speaker and session videos from the 2012 Red Hat Summit and JBoss World:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL995CD1141C3330D5</p>",

    "description": "<p>A JUDCon 2012 session presented by Keith Babo.\n\nIn the not too distant past, application integration was widely considered to be a post-deployment consideration.  Development teams implemented business logic and packaged their application for deployment, while system integrators came in after the fact to tie applications together.  With the introduction of Service Oriented Architecture, we began to see a shift where the design and implementation of a service was guided by a desire for application logic to be be used in multiple contexts and to take advantage of services offered by other applications without tightly coupling the implementations.  One of the biggest challenges for developers, however, was how to realize the tangible benefits of SOA without getting swallowed by the tools and frameworks designed to get them there.\n\nThis session provides an in-depth tour of how SwitchYard, the next generation Enterprise Service Bus from JBoss, gets you to SOA, easy.  There's something for everyone in this talk.  Java EE developers will see how a small set of annotations can be used to turn CDI beans into providers and consumers of enterprise services.  Inject references to enterprise services directly into your Java EE web applications!  Application integrators will witness the wonder of declarative transformation, the flexibility of policy-based service constrains, and the power of an Apache Camel-based routing engine with tons of EIP.  Business savvy folks will find multiple options for service orchestration including BPMN 2.0 and BPEL.  In the end, everyone wins when these features are tied together with rapid application development tooling, a consistent, standards-based configuration model, a top-notch testing framework, and deployment options ranging from embedded to cloud.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A JUDCon 2012 session presented by Kris Verlaenen\n\nImplementing a standards based Health Information Exchange in a large Healthcare System is a difficult task. Many healthcare software systems do not natively interoperate with modern standards based exchanges. The Health Information Exchange at Hartford Healthcare is based on specifications and standards defined by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (www.ihe.net). This group aims to improve the way computer systems in healthcare exchange information. One of the major difficulties encountered during this project was the lack of native interoperability between various source data systems and the Health Information Exchange implementation. \n\nTo address this need the Interoperability group implemented key functionality which facilitated the easy exchange of data between hospital based systems and the exchange. The functionality was developed as native JBoss ESB services. Along with these services a JBoss ESB native gateway was developed to facilitate the exchange of HL7 messages between various parts of the system. Beside serving as a critical part of the internal health information exchange between Hartford Healthcare entities the platform was also deployed during a statewide pilot project at 3 other hospitals. The software assets from this project are freely available at the Open Health Tools forge (www.openhealthtools.org) under an Apache license.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Red Hat President of Products and Technologies Paul Cormier gives a keynote at the Red Hat Summit and JBoss World 2011.\n\nCormier reviews the last decade of Linux and open source development, both in and outside of Red Hat. He talks about the movement of enterprise open source software from minor servers to major mission-critical deployments throughout the industry, and the role of open development in today's cutting edge technologies.\n\nRather than the locked-in horizontal stacks of the 80s and 90s, open source gives choice to developers, to CIOs, to partners and to users. Cormier warns that Red Hat competitors would love to end that choice and return to the days of proprietary control--and shows in quotes pulled from their own presentations the conflicting messages from others in the market.\n\nCormier also discusses the role of open source in today's cloud technologies, and shows how Red Hat's technical development philosophies and business model have helped create that change in infrastructure and the datacenter. \n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5</p>",

In order to deliver high-performance capabilities, Accenture considers open source a key component.\n\nAccenture has continued to see a rise in open source adoption and expansion because of better quality, security, flexibility, and opportunity delivered by companies like Accenture and its partners (including Red Hat). These alliances work hard with their customers to create ever-improving innovative business solutions.\n\nDaugherty also discusses trends and shifts in the technology industry, including cloud computing, data, analytics, and architectures, and examines how today's computing is service-centric instead of server-centric. These developments only heighten the importance of security and access control. He also touches on the usefulness and necessity of social media and platforms--another method by which companies can listen and understand what customers like best, and need most.\n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C33</p>",

Let's skip having to learn three different languages and jumpstart the development process using what you already know. We'll utilize Titanium to create a native mobile application targeting multiple mobile platforms. Next, we'll deploy our backend app to the cloud using JBoss AS and hook it up to our mobile app via a REST API. Finally we'll pull out our smartphones and bask in the awesomeness of our apps! Nothing complicated, nothing convoluted. Just straight ahead mobile development goodness with JBoss and MongoDB.</p>",

    "title": "JUDCon 2012 - Modular Java EE in the Cloud",
    "description": "<p>A JUDCon 2012 session presented by Paul Bakker\n\nDesigning a system that can evolve without creating a maintenance nightmare is far from trivial and there are no silver bullets to do this correctly. A service oriented, modular architecture will help a lot to achieve this goal. Modularity forces separation of concerns which, when combined with a service oriented architecture, enables you to replace parts of a system without breaking others. The only mature modularity approach for Java is OSGi. OSGi is a framework that enables low-level modularity and services, but it is not an application framework like Java EE, i.e.  you still need APIs to create web applications, use transactions, access data sources etc. Without these APIs you will have a hard time to actually build applications. Unfortunately OSGi and Java EE did not interoperate well in the past; it was very challenging to mix both. But what if we want modularity in our architecture, but also the ease-of-use of Java EE 6?\n\nLuckily times are changing. All major application servers are getting support for deploying mixed Java EE and OSGi applications. This makes it possible to deploy OSGi bundles that contain Java EE 6 code such as EJBs, JPA and JAX-RS resources. CDI can be used to inject OSGi services and EJBs can easily be exported as OSGi services too.\n\nThe next question is how to deploy this into the cloud. Just uploading a large WAR file to a server in the cloud doesn't fit modularity very well. How can you update just parts of a running application without breaking the rest of it? We will introduce Apache ACE, an Open Source Provisioning Platform to deploy OSGi bundles (containing Java EE code) and other artifacts to the cloud.</p>",

While JBoss ESB is the current foundation of JBoss SOA Platform, the next major version of the platform will use SwitchYard at its core.  So what are the differences between these two projects, why are we making this change, and how will it impact JBoss users and developers?  This session covers all that and more:\n\n• Past, present and future of JBoss ESB and SwitchYard\n• Similarities and differences between the projects\n• Detailed walkthrough of migration strategies for existing ESB applications\n• Practical tips for service development on both platforms\n\nIf you're interested in ESBs in general or the JBoss-flavored ones in particular, come join the project leads for JBoss ESB and SwitchYard for this informative session.  There will be straight talk, expert advice, loads of examples, interactive discussion, and dancing bears.</p>",

MongoDB makes writing software apps easier and faster through cloud computing and resultant changes in database technologies.\n\nMongoDB is a better fit for open source (iterative) software development.  It lends scalability and agility to the development process. OpenShift and PaaS give developers a full stack that can be used to develop and deploy apps without hardware or IT overhead. 10gen's MongoDB is a layer in that stack.\n\nThis short video supports a talk that Red Hat CTO Brian Stevens gave at the 2012 Red Hat Summit.

He will also spend a significant part of the session discussing configuration management and automation techniques as they are key factors for success in the OpenShift environment.\n\nLiving in the public cloud has significant security implications that will be discussed in depth. Tools and concepts such as SELinux, update lifecycle management, and \"SSL/TLS Everywhere\" are not just good ideas, but crucial to succeeding in the public cloud. Brett will cover tools and techniques for easing the integration of these and other security tools.\n\nBrett will also discuss how identifying powerful, reusable design patterns has allowed the OpenShift team to find efficiencies, enabling it to move at a rapid pace and not just put out fires, but to continually roll out new features and incremental functionality improvements.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Senior Software Maintenance Engineer Neil Horman from Red Hat demonstrates cgroups, a generic mechanism the kernel provides for grouping of processes and applying controls to those groups. The grouping is done via a virtual filesystem called 'cgroup.' Within this filesytem, each directory defines a new group. \n\nTunables within a cgroup are provided by what the kernel calls 'controllers.' Each controller is able to expose one or more tunable or control. When mounting the cgroups filesystem, it is possible to mount the filesystem several times, with each mount point having a different set of (non-overlapping) controllers. The key idea is that this allows the administrator to construct differing group hierarchies for different sets of controllers/tunables, which offers new ways to control and manage cloud resources.\n\nSee what else is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/rhel/server/details/</p>",

    "description": "Hear from Rafael Benevides, Director of Developer Experience at Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017.\n\nThe \"deploy moment\" is an occasion that still causes many developers to shiver. But it shouldn't be this way, at least not every time. Deployment failures, customer downtime, hundreds of calls to customer service—we've all been there. Luckily, today we have the tools and processes to turn the deploy moment into just another ordinary activity. In this session, we'll show you how to evolve your deployment process from the very basic zero downtime with some very interesting additional strategies such as blue/green, A/B, and canary deployments. You'll learn how to not only deploy your software faster, with a vastly better uptime, but how to use container technologies like OpenShift to get business feedback—and recover some well-deserved sleep time.\n\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/sessions</p>",

Today the team is approximately 350+ people and growing, supporting several enterprise products (Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, OpenShift Container Platform, and OpenShift Online). When the founders of Agile envisioned the manifesto and principles, it can be said that they were not thinking in terms of the scale that large enterprises need to put in place in order to deliver products. In fact, this industry is struggling to define what scaled Agile even means. In this session, we will cover how scaling Agile is hurting our industry, learn about what the founders originally intended, and discuss many challenges: - Growing from small teams into large organizations - Handling communication and technical dependencies across many teams - Subject matter expertise that isn’t easily transferable - An effective organizational structure - And the eternal problem: people are people and sometimes just don’t get along.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/sessions</p>",

    "description": "Hear from Paul Morie, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat and Todd Sanders, Director, Software Engineering, Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017\n\nConnectivity is not enough to implement microservices-based systems on Kubernetes. Application authors want a seamless service experience that includes connectivity and adding coordinates, credentials, and configuration into their applications. To meet this need, the Kubernetes service catalog uses the Open Service Broker application programming interface (API) to connect any application deployed in Kubernetes to a wide variety of service brokers in a microservices-based software enivronment. The Open Service Broker API lets service operators integrate with multiple platforms using a single API specification. As a result of this integration pattern, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across different types of services from different producers, while service producers benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple platforms. In this session, we'll cover the high-level concepts of the Open Service Broker API and show a glimpse of a beautiful future where Post-it notes, carrier pigeons, and long-distance runners are no longer involved in app configuration.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHear from Paul Morie, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat and Todd Sanders, Director, Software Engineering, Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017\n\nConnectivity is not enough to implement microservices-based systems on Kubernetes.

In this session, we’ll discuss Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, an application platform that runs legacy applications alongside greenfield polyglot microservices on Red Hat OpenShift, helping enterprises embrace microservices and cloud computing at their own pace. You'll learn the tradeoffs of microservices and monolithic architectures, as well as the costs and benefits of deconstructing a monolithic architecture. You'll also learn how legacy applications and greenfield applications written in Eclipse Vert.x, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and MicroProfile, and Spring Boot can take advantage of a common set of cloud platform services for application interoperability, security, and manageability. With this knowledge, you can build a cloud roadmap that is optimized for your enterprise.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/session</p>",

    "description": "Steven Pousty, Lead Developer Evangelist OpenShift Online, Red Hat and Michael McCune, Sr. Software Engineer, Red Hat present in this Red Hat Summit 2017 breakout session.\n\nData crunching and web serving have existed very separate worlds. Access by a web application to analysis required a long process of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL), database work, and imports and exports, as well as getting network and storage assistance. The rise of containers, orchestration, more cost-effective computing and networking has resulted in a convergence, creating the possibility of using the same hardware and, more importantly, clustering software to converge both types of workloads. In this session, we’ll discuss a high level vision of this approach with containers, Kubernetes, web servers, and Apache Spark. We’ll show a demo of how this convergence helps data analysis move from custom R or Python scripts on an analyst’s desktop to an accessible web app, while letting the analyst simultaneously constrain the analysis to prevent statistical overreach.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/session</p>",

    "title": "The hardest part of microservices is your data",
    "description": "Hear from Christian Posta, Principal Architect, Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017.\n\nOne of the tenants of microservices, and a way to minimize dependencies, is that “a service should own its own database.” This is easier said than done. Why? Because: your data. In working with data in information systems for 5 decades, application developers have accepted the practice of using relational databases and relying on all of their safety guarantees. But, as we build services architectures that span more than one database by design (as with microservices), things get harder. How do we synchronize data across databases, especially heterogeneous data? Developing for the traditional enterprise, we have to build fast-changing systems that are surrounded by legacy systems with complicated domains like finance, insurance, and retail. So, how do we develop and reason about the boundaries in our system to reduce complexity in the domain?\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore these problems and see how domain driven design (DDD) helps grapple with the domain complexity. We’ll see how DDD concepts like entities and aggregates help us understand boundaries—based on use cases and how transactions are affected. With transactional boundaries, we can more carefully adjust our needs from the CAP theorem to scale out and achieve autonomous systems with eventual strictly ordered consistency. We’ll see how technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Camel, and Debezium.io can help build the backbone for these types of systems. And finally, we’ll look at a working example that brings all of this together.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/session</p>",

Ever tried to look under the hood of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) specification and felt lost? Thermostat is a open source instrumentation and service tool that can help Java developers understand what is happening inside JVM when their programs are running. Thermostat collects and combines information from various sources—including the Hotspot VM—to present a complete picture of how an application is behaving. In this session, you’ll see Thermostat in action as it is used to examine various Java applications, as well as identify and fix problems—often without even modifying application code.

    "description": "Hear from Clement Escoffier, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017.\n\nEclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to create reactive distributed and polyglot applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It takes the JVM to new levels of performance, yet has a small API. It lets you build scalable, microservice-based applications transparently distributed and packaged as a single jar file. This simplicity makes deploying and managing Vert.x applications on OpenShift a breeze. Upload your jar and Vert.x connects all your pods and services. That's not all, the application you're developing with Vert.x is \"reactive\": It's responsive, elastic, resilient, uses asynchronous message-passing saving resources, and handles a huge level of concurrency. How does that work on OpenShift?\n\nIn this session, you'll see how the combination of Vert.x and OpenShift paves a new way to build and manage reactive systems. You'll see several examples and a demonstration of how Vert.x simplifies not only development, but thanks to OpenShift, the deployment and management of your distributed system. Everything you need will be covered in this session: service discovery, resilience pattern, rolling updates, monitoring, and metrics. This is a \"slide-less\" session consisting of pure, live coding.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/session</p>",

    "description": "Ryan Hennessy, Sr. Solution Architect, Red Hat and Guna Vijayaratnam, Solutions Architect, Red Hat speak in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017.\n\nThe Red Hat team had the opportunity to work with a lot of customers, this one, in particular, was struggling with their application deployment process. Their current processes were fragile and didn’t meet the business needs to be more flexible, automated, and cloud-centric. The customer IT department realized if they didn’t address these problems soon there was a high risk that individual business units were going to start looking to other partners for serving their IT needs. In this session, we will cover in depth the following areas:\n\nMain hosting focus areas and business drivers that lead to the adoption of OpenShift\n\nApplication delivery methodologies that were modernized using\n\nOpenShift How OpenShift was able to directly solve the challenges and focus areas set out by IT leadership.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/sessions</p>",

In this session, members of Red Hat’s Business Systems and Intelligence Group will demonstrate how to implement business applications with minimal coding effort. Starting from a simple relational data model, the team will use the new web-based tooling platform to build out customizable forms using a drag and drop based form modeler and page editor. They will show how to define an application flow based on these forms and integrate existing business rules and processes before they package and deploy the running application on OpenShift. The team will also demonstrate how to extend the generated application by adding custom components, that fully integrate into the drag and drop capabilities. As a final step, the team will show how to create and bundle application components into a repository to make them discoverable and available for reuse within other applications.\n\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017/agenda/session</p>",

    "description": "<p>Emmanuel Bernard\nAfter graduating from Supelec (French \"Grande Ecole\"), Emmanuel has spent a few years in the retail industry as developer and architect where he started to be involved in the ORM space. He joined the Hibernate team in 2003 and is now a platform architect at JBoss, by Red Hat. Emmanuel is the lead developer of Hibernate Annotations and Hibernate EntityManager, two key projects on top of Hibernate Core implementing the Java Persistence(tm) specification. He also has founded and leads Hibernate Search and Hibernate Validator.\n\nEmmanuel is a member of the JPA 2.0 expert group and the spec lead of JSR 303: Bean Validation. He is a regular speaker at various conferences and JUGs, including JavaOne, JBoss World and Devoxx and the co-author of Hibernate Search in Action published by Manning.\n\nHibernate OGM: JPA on Infinispan: when PaaS persistence meets Java EE\n\nPaaS (Platform as a Service) is all the buzz these days. But how and where do you store your data is the real challenge. In a data grid to benefit from its scalability? Via a new proprietary API?\nJBoss users of our enterprise middleware systems are accustomed to easy persistence via Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API). What if Hibernate could store your data in a grid?\n\nHibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) aims at offering a JPA front end (object manipulation and JP-QL query) to applications while storing and querying the data from a key/value grid like Infinispan. In other words, offering a familiar and well known API but benefiting from the new scalability possibilities of distributed data grids like Infinispan. That includes trying to support existing applications using JPA.\n\nIn this presentation, we will see how JBoss is leveraging its existing technology to build an OGM (Object/Grid Mapper). Hibernate Core (JPA), Hibernate Search (object search engine), Teiid (query federation engine) and of course Infinispan (distributed data grid) are the foundation to this adventure. We will cover in details how the various bricks fit together, what the secret sauce is and how to use the solution in your applications.</p>",

Has the Maven archetype syntax left you scratching your head? Everyone else is talking about Rails, Grails, and Roo, and you’re left thinking, “I wish it were that easy for me.” Well, there’s good news: You don’t have to leave Java EE just to find a developer tool that makes starting out simple. Seam Forge is heating up Java EE, and is ready to work it into a full-fledged project.\n\nSeam Forge is also an incremental enhancement tool that lets you to take an existing Java EE project and safely work in new functionality.

In addition, the application demonstrates OpenShift auto-scaling - as new users sign into the system and begin entering bids additional gears come online to handle the load. We opened up the demo application to over 1000 live audience members and had some fun.  In addition, you will get a sneak peak of some of our JBoss Developer Studio Apache Cordova tooling that is incubating in the community.  The majority of the application is written in JavaScript (Aerogear) along with Ruby (TorqueBox) and Clojure (Immutant).   In addition, this demonstration worked over both OpenShift and Amazon EC2 - a hybrid cloud approach.</p>",

    "description": "<p>www.jboss.org/webinars\n\nIn this session, we will address the missing link in Enterprise Java development: simple, easy integration testing.\n\nUnit tests and mock objects will only take you so far; the only answer which truly ensures that all components are playing nicely is a comprehensive integration suite. Unfortunately, writing integration tests has historically involved manual setup of a heavy, cumbersome test harness. That's time lost, but it doesn't have to be anymore.\n\nHere we will introduce Arquillian, a powerful container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit. Arquillian manages your runtime, abstracting out deployment and allowing you to focus on real test logic.\n\nTransparent container lifecycle management\nDeclarative deployments\nTest Enrichment (Dependency injection into tests)\nIn-container test execution\nAll examples will be powered by the new lean offering from the JBoss Community: Application Server 7. Attend this webinar to learn how the simplified component model of Java EE6 can be applied to testable development.\n\nPresenter Bio: Andrew Rubinger is an advocate for and speaker on testable enterprise Java development, author of \"Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1\" from O'Reilly Media. Member of the JBoss Application Server development team and technical lead of the ShrinkWrap project. Proudly employed by JBoss / Red Hat.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Developers want to release code as fast as possible. Compute clouds want developers to release code to them. This is a story about how these two goals converge. The jclouds project formerly used JBoss AS6 to perform functional testing of compute clouds. We felt running an application server is a pretty useful model for what developers look to achieve. When we moved to JBoss AS7, we were expecting a relatively smooth update. In reality, we found a surprising performance story! This presentation will review performance considerations when deploying application servers across multiple cloud providers. We'll discuss to install, bootstrap, and reboot time that affect your agility with real numbers on over a dozen compute clouds like Amazon EC2. This is a no-hype talk: when you leave, you'll know how to make your own jclouds tests to test your cloud deployment of choice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This presentation unveils the missing link in enterprise Java development: simple, portable integration tests. We’ll introduce a solution in the first half of the session and demonstrate it in the second.  Unit tests and mocks get you only so far.  Eventually you need to verify that your components operate and interact correctly in\ntheir intended environment you need integration tests. Yet writing integration tests has meant taking on the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure.\nArquillian, a container-oriented testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit, tears down this barrier. It enables you to write portable tests that invoke real components using real enterprise services in a real runtime. In other words, you can write real tests.\nAnd with JBoss AS7, getting your code fi red up and running has never been faster. This latest rebirth of the Application Server is the leanest, most efficient we’ve seen yet.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Google App Engine (GAE) is among the most popular cloud application platforms today, offering decent service at a low price point or even for free. Unfortunately, however, its Java environment is also fairly restrictive. This session presents several tips and tricks on how to use top Java EE specs – CDI, JPA, JSF2, and Bean Validation, for instance – within GAE’s restrictive sandbox while still benefi ting from the highly scalable environment it provides and maintaining portability to other Java EE containers. It demonstrates how CDI can be used to abstract from GAE’s services and how state-of-the-art testing frameworks such as ShrinkWrap and Arquillian can be made to work with a GAE application.</p>",

    "title": "Extreme Performance and Scalability with Near Caches by Galder Zamarreno at JUDCon London 2011",
    "description": "<p>The aim of near caching is to provide a bridge between fast, in-memory, local caching and remote, massively scalable, Data Grids in such way that most recently or most frequently accessed data is quickly available while at the same time, clients still being able to transparently and seamlessly access the remote Data Grid when needed. Due to zero latency access provided for local data and the scalability offered by the possibility of going to a remote Data Grid, it’s no wonder that this is one of the most demanded Infi nispan patterns. In this talk, Galder will offer a detailed view of the pattern with a look at best practices for deploying it in your own environment. The talk will finish with a demo showing near caching in action!</p>",

    "title": "JPA Applications in the Era of NoSQL and Clouds – Introducing OGM by Hardy Ferentschik @ JUDCon London",
    "description": "<p>Clouds are an interesting deployment platform, but managing state in dynamically scalable environments is not an easy task. There exist a whole range of different NoSQL solutions with strong differences in performance, capabilities, reliability, isolation and ease of use. In this talk we discuss briefl y the different NoSQL solutions and show where Hibernate OGM fits into the picture.  Hibernate OGM (Object Grid Mapper) is built on the robust and proven Hibernate core engine and helps you to port existing JPA (Hibernate) applications to alternative storage engines decoupling application code from a specific NoSQL solution. The project is relatively new and not all JPA features are supported; also only one storage engine is supported at the moment: Infinispan. Hardy will explain how OGM is designed, what to expect next and how to plug in your own storage engine. All this is accompanied with a demo showing how easy it is to get started.</p>",

In any case, if you encounter a problem starting your JBoss Application Server - check the tip in this video about making sure you have a JRE.\n\nThis video also provides an overview of the JBoss Central capabilities.

A basic setup using a web server and a directory tree is no-longer sufficient for many organizations.  As the organization's Maven repository grows, a fully featured Maven repository manager can provide things like staging, validation, and simpler build configuration.\n\nThis session will discuss the challenges faced when creating a Maven repository infrastructure for your organization.  The basic concepts of a Maven repository will be introduced, followed by a discussion with several examples of how Maven is configured to use repositories.  The limitations and potential problems of a basic setup will be discussed, including how these problems might be solved using a Maven repository manager.  The JBoss Community Maven repository will be examined including the problems with the previous setup, how the repositories were rebuilt to address these problems, and what are the plans for the future of the JBoss repository.\n\nThe goal of this session is to explain the basic concepts of Maven repositories and repository managers, compare the advantages and disadvantages of several possible repository configurations, and provide enough information so that you can begin desiging your own repository infrastructure.\n\nIt is recommended that attendees have at least a basic understanding of Maven and a general knowledge of Java and related software.</p>",

That means your Java Enterprise Edition 6 app server (JBoss AS7) running with JSF 2, CDI, JMS, bean validation, etc…, but enhanced with device and feature detection, HTML5 and CSS3. This is a very technical session, that will assume some understanding on the mobile web and JSF. Don't worry, if you saw Burr Sutter's webinar on September 21st (http://vimeo.com/29403374), and have basic knowledge of JSF you'll be all set.\n\nWith JSF 2 and RichFaces 4 you can still get the advantages of working with Java EE6 while working with the latest in client technology. It's not all good news though and we'll go over some of the pitfalls of working with JSF on mobile devices, and how you can work around them.</p>",

That it future-proofs you during refactoring but with too many moving parts, it's hard to fault even the most savvy developer for giving up. Tests have been slow to write, slow to execute, and push back our deadlines.\nIt doesn't have to be that way anymore.\nIn this session, we'll explore techniques to skip the build and stay within the IDE, reduce boilerplate by harnessing an annotation-driven framework, and hook into some common embeddable EE containers from a plain JavaSE environment.\n\nPresenter: As Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat, Andrew Lee Rubinger is primarily tasked with development of the JBoss Community's EJB 3.x implementation. He is the author of the upcoming “Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1, 6th Edition” from O’Reilly Media, and his role as Core Developer within the JBoss Application Server is supplemented by leading the EmbeddedAS and ShrinkWrap projects.

    "title": "JBoss AS7 for Spring Developers",
    "description": "<p>Presenter: Marius Bogoevici\n\nDescription: Getting the best experience while developing Spring applications owes a lot to running them on a state-of-the-art application server. In this session, we will show you how JBoss AS7 with its new architecture and a new set of features provides an ideal environment for developing and deploying Spring applications.\n\nThere are multiple ways in which a Spring developer can benefit from the overall goodness that is JBoss AS7. On one hand, you can use it as a generic Java EE 6 application server and stay up-to-date with the latest enterprise Java specification, while continuing to use your favorite development model. However, for advanced users, taking advantage of features which are unique to JBoss AS is what can provide a competitive edge, and in this webinar we will cover both angles.\n\nThis webinar is addressing developers and architects that use Spring in their applications, both new to JBoss AS or seasoned users of a previous version of it. For new users, it will demonstrate how to run Spring applications in JBoss AS7. and for existing users it will distill the new features of JBoss AS7 from a Spring user perspective, including how Snowdrop, the JBoss extension for Spring is addressing their needs.\n\nSince staying in touch with technical advances is critical for the success of an enterprise application, a question often asked is how can Spring developers blend with CDI, the Java EE 6 native dependency injection model, to create applications which are both future-proof, but also friendly to existing code, which is another important aspect of adopting JBoss AS7 as the runtime of choice. In response to that, the webinar will cover the Spring/CDI integration which currently exists as part of the Seam project.\n\nPresenter Bio: Marius Bogoevici is a Senior Software Engineer with Red Hat, leading the JBoss AS/Spring integration efforts. He is currently the lead for Snowdrop, a utility package that contains JBoss-specific extensions to the Spring Framework. He makes regular contributions to Weld, the JSR-299 Reference Implementation.\n\nMarius has an extensive experience of more than 14 years developing and architecting software systems. Prior to joining Red Hat, he was a Spring consultant with SpringSource. He is a contributor to the Spring Integration enterprise integration framework and co-author of \"Spring Integration in Action\".</p>",

    "description": "<p>This webinar will provide in-depth coverage of several new JSF 2.0 features.  It will also ask of each : Is the current solution sufficient?  Where is it lacking?  We'll then review how RichFaces 4 is enhancing JSF to solve these issues by prototyping functionality for the future of JSF.\n\nThe JSF 2.0 specification (JSR-314) addresses a substantial number of long standing pain points that JSF users have just come to accept as a hard knock life.  JSF 2.0 is a true contender amongst web frameworks.  It is not the end of the story though, and thankfully the expert group has once again left the door open for projects like RichFaces to extent, prototype and improve the specification.  RichFaces lead the industry with ajax support for JSF1.2, played a significant role in the development of JSF 2.0, and continues to lead and prototype the future of the JSF standard for the RIA ecosystem.\n\nWhether you are a new JSF/RichFaces user who wants to find out more about the latest developments in the specification or an old hat with an issue or two on your mind, this session has something to offer you!</p>",

While it is especially strong on JBoss software, it is in no means limited to it.\n\nThis session will give an overview of JBoss Operations Network (JBossON) and its downstream, RHQ-project. The overview shows the architecture and will then give a walk through the UI and shows the extension points of JBoss Operations Network and RHQ. In the live demo you will see how to quickly start with JBossON, take resources into inventory and even deploy new software to a managed machine.\n\nPresenter: Heiko Rupp\n\nHeiko works for Red Hat and is Senior Developer on the  RHQ project. He studied Computer Science at University of Karlsruhe and used to create open source software for a long time. Heiko has written the first German book about JBossAS and one of the first German books on EJB3.\nHaving worked on Service Level Management before, he joined after being a Consultant the JBoss Operations Network team in 2006 and has been working on RHQ and JBossON since then.\n\nWhen not working or otherwise hacking, Heiko likes running, playing with the kids and traveling. He lives in Stuttgart, Germany</p>",

We setup a network using equipment you can purchase at your local electronics store and built a mini-datacenter for the stage.   We required WIFI connectivity, internet access, a live Twitter stream, audience participation and even managed to avoid system failure while \"pulling the plug\" on one of our servers.   In short, we pulled off something miraculous, a maximum risk, live demonstration and lived to tell (actually tweet) about it!\nKey Proof points:\n\n- lightweight & embeddable - you will want to cram as many applications on the smallest possible machines\n- adaptable & available - you will need it to be highly elastic but also fault-tolerant\n- real-time - we live in a world where decisions must be made instantly\n\nKey technologies:\n\n- HTML5 - for real-time visualization of an elastic data grid (Infinispan)\n- Mobile web - all UIs were mobile web ready - demonstrated on iOS and Android devices\n- JSF2 and RichFaces4 - with real-time server-side push to the browser\n- Infinispan - All data held in the data grid - no database, NoSQL\n- Hibernate OGM (Object Grid Mapper) - even though there is no database, we can still access the data grid as if it were a relational database, using JPA and Hibernate\n- Drools - the data stream analyzer, allows us to sort the important and actionable information from the raw stream of data.\n- CDI - Contexts and Dependency Injection - the programming model of EE6 and JBoss\n- GWT and Errai - extending the CDI event model from the server out to the client\n\nMore details at: http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote</p>",

Seam, based on standardized contextual dependency injection (JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection) allows you to port your code and skillset into the cloud. We will demo advanced integration with GWT toolkit for real-time ultra rich applications and data grid capabilities for a highly elastic middle-tier, running live in popular public cloud providers.\n\nPresenter: Pete Muir is the project lead for Seam and Weld (the reference implementation of JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE), and is the co-founder of Arquillian, a test harness for Java application servers. Pete represented JBoss on the JSF 2.0 Expert Group. Pete is currently employed by Red Hat, as a core developer working on JBoss open source projects. Before working for Red Hat, Pete used and contributed to Seam whilst working for a UK based staffing agency as IT Development Manager.\n\nPete has spoken at conferences such as Devoxx, JAX, JBoss World, JSFDays and JavaBlend as well as numerous JUGs.

    "description": "<p>We are currently working on the integration of Forge in JBoss Tools. Lincoln's excellent screencast inspired me to write up a tutorial that shows how his work looks in the context of JBoss Tools. In true Hollywood style, this is basically a remake of Lincoln's version. We will create, deploy and debug a simple JEE web application on JBoss AS but this time using JBoss Tools.\n\nFull blog post at community.jboss.org/community/tools/blog/2011/05/11/have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too-forge-tools</p>",
