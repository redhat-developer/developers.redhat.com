    title: 'fabric8 - Java developer tools for Kubernetes and OpenShift'
    date: 'Monday at 17:25 - 17:55'
    location: 'Room 4'
    description: 'Fabric8 is an integration and management platform adding to the Java developer&rsquo;s perspective of Kubernetes and OpenShift. It consists of multiple parts.  Fabric8 tooling helps tremendously in deploying Java applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift by creating all the complex deployment descriptors directly from a Java build. In addition, fabric8 contains a rich set of DevOps Microservices which provides a flexible and automatedsetup for a Continous Integration and Delivery pipeline on a per project basis.  It also includes an integration-Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) centered around Camel and ActiveMQ with rich visualisations and one click installations. But the queen of fabric8 is its web console which allows for a rich user experience for managing Kubernetes services, pods and more. With this in place even complex setups can be easily managed.  This talk provides an overview over all these components and shows how the pieces fit together.'

    title: 'Docker Tooling for JavaEE Developers'
    date: 'Monday at 18:05 - 18:35'
    location: 'Room 5'
    description: 'Docker is awesome, but how to use it well when doing Java development? In this talk you will get a quick introduction on how to use Docker effectively, especially for Java EE development. We will show how the recent release of Eclipse Mars supports Docker to make it even more integrated into your day-to-day work from within your IDE. In particular, you&rsquo;ll see how you can pull and run an image for a database, build a custom image for an application server, run it and deploy a JavaEE application using data volume, exposed ports and container links. And more! '

    date: 'Wednesday at 12:00 - 13:00'
    location: 'Room 4'
    description: 'Have you ever used an open source project? Of course you have, but have you made any contributions yourself? Filed a bug report? Submitted a patch? Have you ever started your own OSS project, or taken a closed/private project public? What licenses should you use? How do you manage contributions? How do you support contributors and still get work done? What do you do with difficult community members? In this talk we&rsquo;ll go over the basics of OSS: how to get involved, how to start a project, how to manage contributions. We&rsquo;ll discuss project lifecycles, legal CYA tips, and how to keep projects moving. You&rsquo;ll see the inner workings of real OSS projects, and learn how to be a better OSS user and producer.

    date: 'Wednesday at 14:00 - 15:00'
    location: 'Room 4'
    description: 'Ruby has come a long way since JRuby first ran Rails in 2006. Frameworks like Rails have grown up with the modern web, now supporting web sockets, microservices, and integration with Javascript client libraries like Ember. Concurrency utilities modeled after the JDK are helping Ruby scale horizontally. Applications can be built with Rake - or with JRuby plugins for Gradle and Maven. Maven poms can be written in a beautiful Ruby DSL. Swing, JavaFX, and other graphics libraries become easy and fun with JRuby. Sass and Asciidoctor are already being used in Java apps thanks to JRuby. And you can bundle up the whole thing in an executable jar or war file; your devops will never know it&rsquo;s Ruby. Come see what JRuby 9000 can do for you in 2015.'

    date: 'Thursday at 13:25 - 13:30'
    location: 'Room BOF 1'
    description: 'I truly don&rsquo;t believe we engage in any activity expecting it to fail, and same goes for app development. I remember an old statistics that compared software projects to airplanes development, which would say that only 30% would take off without significative problems. I got scared when I first heard about it, but then I looked back on the projects I worked for, and even though the numbers weren&rsquo;t so bad, there was really a considerable amount of projects that failed and some miserably, but there is a deep relationship between failing and innovating. DevOps for me can be the main driver and accelerator of innovation. We all know that change is a constant, but so is failure. Having that, your development and operations is wrong, if changes and failures are seen as the result of bad decisions more than as result of a learning curve. But failing is not simple and on this ignite talk I’ll cover the following considerations around DevOps, failure, and innovation: See your project as an R&D project Expect failure more than you expect change There&rsquo;s no way to run away from &rsquo;people process and tools&rsquo; You need a good enterprise architect. Pray for your boss.'

    title: 'From object oriented to functional domain modeling'
    date: 'Thursday at 12:00 – 13:00'
    location: 'Room 5'
    description: 'The main consequence of the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8 is the possibility of conveniently mixing the object oriented and the functional paradigms. Nevertheless the biggest part of Java developers is not used yet to employ functional idioms and then they are not ready to fully leverage the new functional capabilities of Java. In particular it is still uncommon to see functions used together with data in business domain model. The purpose of this talk is not doing a comparison between object oriented and functional programming, but showing how these two styles can be combined in order to take advantage of the good parts of both. For example it&rsquo;s usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to a inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect free code allows better reusability. This talk will demonstrate the validity of these statements with practical examples till to distil the essence of functional programming: data and behaviours are two aspects of the same thing.'

Vert.x 3 takes the JVM to new levels of reactive awesomeness: it lets you build scalable applications transparently distributed in Java, JavaScript, Ruby and Groovy. And, you don’t have to choose a single language, but mix them! This talk presents the key concepts of Vert.x and how you can use it to build your next application. This session explains how the simple model promoted by Vert.x enables the construction of concurrent, scalable and efficient micro-service based applications. Several examples are developed during the talk and demonstrates Vert.x features such as the distributed event bus, the high availability, the polyglot aspect and vert.x web.'

    title: 'Process-driven applications: let BPM do (some of) your work'
    date: 'Thursday at 10:50 – 11:50'
    location: 'Room 10'
    description: 'Even the simplest application ideas always end up requiring more development than you hoped for: maintaining long-lived state, interaction with other services or human actors performing some of the work, showing current status of ongoing requests, management and reporting, etc. Business processes and rules allow you to externalize some of that logic and dynamically update it, but you don&rsquo;t want your business process management (BPM) system to get in your way either. And every application is different, so you want to be able to fully control every bit of it. Using process-driven application development, you define your application logic in a (flexible) business process, but you also expect your BPM system to help you out with much more than that. In this session we will show you live how to quickly get new web applications up and running by relying on jBPM to provide some of the UI (should you want to), or even to generate parts of your application for you (that you can customize later), so you can focus on what makes your application different. jBPM uses the power of open source and it&rsquo;s flexible architecture to let you decide what you need: nothing more, nothing less.'
