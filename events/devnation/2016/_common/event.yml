    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m."
    abstract: Scale changes everything. What once was quite adequate for enterprise messaging can't scale to support "Internet of Things". We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of Things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we&rsquo;re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.

  - title: "Tracking huge files with Git LFS"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m."
    abstract: "Developers love Git for its raw speed, powerful history traversal, distributed nature, and the fact that it was built by uber developer Linus Torvalds. What we don't love is the fact that, out of the box, Git has terrible support for tracking large binary files. Fortunately, developers from Atlassian, GitHub, and Visual Studio Online have teamed up to work on an open source project to solve this problem: Git LFS (Large File Support). This means researchers, web designers, game developers, multimedia producers, and all other developers who need to work with large data and rich media can move off legacy-centralized systems and start using modern version control. In this session, we'll cover the computer science behind Git LFS' internals and architecture, CLI usage, and how to build an effective Git LFS workflow for a development team. You'll leave with an understanding of how Git LFS works under the hood and some practical advice on using Git LFS with your software projects and teams."

  - title: "Meet the assertable Chaos Monkeys for your Docker system"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m."
    abstract: The production system has been targeted by troublesome random failures over a long period of time, and countless hours of debugging has yielded no valuable results. We're close to throwing in the towel. An army of Chaos Monkeys has been deployed in an attempt to force the issue, but no solution is in sight. We need to take back control. It's time to meet the Assertable Chaos Monkey, Arquillian Cube Q. Arquilian Cube Q is an extension that gives you full control over a production-like system right from the comfort of your IDE. In this session, we'll explore some of the things you can do when you have control over the whole system. We'll validate scalability and connectivity, assert the failure state, enforce service responses, and more.
    speaker: Aslak Knutsen, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat & Bartosz Majsak, Atos Consulting Switzerland
  - title: "Developing with OpenShift without the build waits"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m."
    abstract: As application systems move to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments and every source code change results in a full build, a simple change can easily take minutes. This is much longer than developers are willing to wait to verify a change. And working in the cloud shouldn't mean loss of control and visibility into how an application is working. In this session, we'll cover how OpenShift by Red Hat works closely with Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to let you push code directly to a container, see your changes as you make them, debug live in deployment, and much more.
    speaker: Peter Larsen, Sr. Solutions Architect, Red Hat 
  - title: "An introduction to Eclipse Che: A next-generation Java IDE"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m."
    abstract: What happens when on-demand workspaces powered by Docker are transformed into a new kind of Java IDE accessed through your browser? This session introduces Eclipse Che and shows how a cloud IDE can make developing Java projects fast and powerful. We'll compare Intellisense, content assist, machines, plug-in architecture, and performance when compared to traditional desktop IDEs. Che includes numerous forms of refactoring and uses Docker to initiate environments and machines to build and run code. We'll also cover Maven, Ant, and Gradle extensions and discusses how Che can be extended with custom code templates, Dockerfiles, and plug-ins (authored in Java, of course). Additionally, Che has a Kubernetes and OpenShift plug-in, which provides duality of environments between development and production, all structured on container topologies. We'll discuss how developers are marrying their code with containers and keeping those topologies synchronized between different environments, and the role that IDEs must play in this world.
    speaker: Tyler Jewell, CEO, Codenvy
  - title: "Learning from astronauts how to be better developers"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m."
    abstract: "As developers, we're constantly trying to improve the way we build systems and work as a team. Agile, DevOps, and Lean are all frameworks to help us be better developers and write better systems, but it still seems to be a constant struggle. Commander Chris Hadfield is a bona fide astronaut, test pilot, and rocket scientist, and he commanded the International Space Station for 3 months, making waves back on earth with his cover of Bowie’s Space Oddity. On returning, he wrote a book about everything he learned on his journey to becoming an astronaut. You’d be surprised by how much of it applies to application development. Application development should be easy—it ain't rocket science. In this session, you'll learn: - How Russia represents DevOps and Lean development, while America represents the waterfall method - How to create robust systems by thinking, “What could kill me next?” - How astronauts make amazing teams, and how to apply that in our own environments."
    speaker: Sam Atkinson, Senior Development Specialist, HSBC
  - title: "Putting the 'M' in MBaaS—Red Hat mobile client development platform"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m."
    abstract: When you hear the term "MBaaS," or "Red Hat Mobile," there is usually a lot of discussion about powerful scaling, back-end integrations, hosting options, containerization, etc. However, we can't forget what that "M" stands for, and why the platforms exist in the first place, which is to develop and deliver top-notch mobile applications to your users. In this session, we'll review what makes all of this possible—client SDKs, hybrid solutions like Cordova, and Xamarin, and our own Build Farm and Unified Push server. Not stopping there, our AppForms support makes it a snap to tie in back-end systems all the way to your app. And this is all backed by various templates, guides, and new open source resources that will help you get started and join the fun.
    speaker: Jay Balunas, Red Hat Inc.
  - title: "Agile is a four-letter word"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m."
    abstract: "Based on a wide variety of surveys taken over recent years, many companies are transitioning to something that looks more like Agile than the processes they were using in previous years. However, that transition doesn’t necessarily mean implementations have been done respectfully of the Agile Manifesto and the principles behind it. In large part, industry trends seem to indicate that the sloganization of the word has done a significant disservice to the ideas that were originally founded in 2001. To add even more pain, most people seem to be entirely unaware of the core basis of Agile which is the idea to embrace change but inspect and adapt to that change. Are we lost as an industry? Is there anyway we can recover from this problem? In this session, attendees can expect to engage in a conversation about the rise of the Agile community, the negative and positive impact it has had on the industry, and how you individually can help your organizations and teams lower the risk of encountering the negative problems, and speed your way towards the positives. Topics will include: - The intentions behind agile - Ways you can rework or improve your not so great agile situation - Things you should avoid from the start."
    speaker: Jen Krieger, Chief Agile Architect, Red Hat
  - title: "Java 9 modularity in action"
    date: "MONDAY, JUNE 27: 3:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m."
    abstract: "Java 9 comes to your doorstep with major changes for all of us, whether we ordered it or not. Modularity is the big theme of the Java 9 release, and it requires rethinking how we structure, build, and run Java applications. This is great, because who doesn't like more reliable and secure applications, meanwhile killing the dreaded classpath? Additionally, Java 9 has several other smaller, but useful, features, including support for HTTP 2 and collection factory methods. In this session, we'll dive deep into the module system and other new features. We'll review the basic concepts of modules and explore modularity patterns to enhance your design and development skills, and see examples of what else to expect in Java 9. We'll give plenty examples in this practical and code-driven presentation. You'll be ready for Java 9 before you know it."

  - title: "Analyzing Java applications using Thermostat"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "Ever wondered how your Java application is actually working? How it's making use of scarce resources on your machine? Ever tried to look under the hood of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and felt lost with various tools that don't provide an overall picture, only local details? Thermostat is an open source serviceability tool to help Java developers understand what's happening inside the JVM when their programs are running. Thermostat collects and combines information from various sources—including the Hotspot JVM—to present a complete picture of how the application is behaving. In this session, you'll get a chance to see Thermostat in action as it's used to examine various Java applications, identify what's wrong and fix those problems—often without even modifying the application code. You'll also learn how to add more features to Thermostat through plug-ins. If you're a developer, sysadmin, or QA, and if there's Java in your technology stack, you'll want to learn how Thermostat can make your life easier."

  - title: "Container development for command line developers"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "The container development kit (CDK) provides an on-ramp to building container-based applications by simplifying the configuration and set up of Linux container development environments. One of most talked about use cases is how developers can continue using Eclipse as their IDE, and with the help of Eclipse-docker tooling, utilize the Docker or OpenShift services running in the CDK for container-based development. However the CDK isn't just for Eclipse-based developers. Containers are for everyone and so is the CDK. In this session, we'll show you how to use the CDK to develop for OpenShift and/or Docker+Kubernetes, using command line tools, alternative IDEs, and in a completely virtualized manner. You'll learn: - How to configure your environment, obtain the client tools, and put them to use - Key ideas for integrating with other development environments - To make your development teams ready to work on containers No matter what desktop solution you're using—Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or any other Linux variant—your container development can be enabled with the CDK."
    speaker: Lalatendu Mohanty, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat & Praveen Kumar, Software Engineer, Red Hat & Navid Shaikh, SoftwareEngineer, Red Hat
  - title: "Optimizing code for modern processors"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "Programmers use a simple sequential model of how a processor executes steps in a program, but in reality the processor's implementation is much more complex. The processor employs techniques that exploit typical characteristics of the code allowing the processor to execute the code much faster than the simple programmer's model and reduce the cost of some individual instructions by a factor of ten to one-hundred. However, the processor must preserve the behavior that the programmer expects and fallback to the slower methods when the optimization would yield results that differ from the programmer's model. Mechanisms such as caches, pipelines, branch prediction, and threading are commonly used in modern processors to improve performance. In this session, we'll explain the performance implications of these mechanisms, how to identify specific performance issues such as poor caching and branch prediction using the tools available on Linux and some optimization techniques that better match code and hardware capabilities."
    speaker: William Cohen, Performance Tools Engineer, Red Hat, Inc.
  - title: "Software Collections: Easy access to the cutting edge"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "In most subscriptions, Red Hat offers access to the Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) and Developer Toolset (DTS). RHSCL has 20+ content sets, providing recent-but-stable versions of languages, databases, web servers, etc.—like, ruby 2.2, postgresql 9.4, and nginx 1.6—that you use for development and production runtime. The DTS provides recent-but-stable content used mainly in development—for example, Eclipse, gcc, git. Come learn how and when to use this content in RPMs and Docker containers. We will show you how to launch Drupal in minutes and install Eclipse Mars. We will also demonstrate how to build containers using this content, which makes your Dockerfiles much simpler. Lastly, we will show you how OpenShift 3 can use the same content sets."

  - title: "From object-oriented to functional-domain modeling"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m."
    abstract: "The main consequence of the introduction of lambda expressions in Java 8 is the possibility of conveniently mixing the object-oriented and the functional paradigms. It's still uncommon to see functions used together with data in the business domain model. For example, it's usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to an inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect-free code allows better reusability. In this session, we're: -- Not going to compare object-oriented and functional programming -- Are going to show how the two styles can be combined to take advantage of the good parts of each -- Going to look at practical examples to distill the essence of functional programming"

  - title: "Building reactive applications with Node.js and Red Hat JBoss Data Grid"
    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m."
    abstract: "Node.js is a very popular framework for developing asynchronous, event-driven, reactive applications. Red Hat JBoss Data Grid, an in-memory distributed database designed for fast access to large volumes of data and scalability, has recently gained compatibility with Node.js letting reactive applications use it as a persistence layer. Thanks to near caching, JBoss Data Grid offers excellent response times for data queried regularly, and its continuous remote event support means data can get pushed from the data grid to the Node.js application instead of having to wait for the data grid to serve it. In this session, we'll show how to build Node.js applications that use JBoss Data Grid as a persistence layer."

    date: "TUESDAY, JUNE 28: 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m."
    abstract: "Through the years, Java has become much more than just a programming language. It's also an enterprise platform for JEE application development. However, at some level, security and cryptography are easy to get wrong. Most of the time, we don't care which algorithms—SHA-256 or SHA-512, RSA or ECC, AES-128 or AES-256, padding schemes, iteration number, key sizes—are or aren't ideal for encryption, or if a poor choice could benefit attackers. In this technical session, we won't use complex math, and most of the concepts will be illustrated with source code, as we explore: - Broken cryptography - Libraries available for development - Hashing passwords and what people have been doing wrong - Usage of digital signatures - Protecting local data - How to properly exchange encryption keys - Securely sending data over the network - Preventing illegal tampering on client/server applications - SSL best practices - Cryptography in our daily basis"

    date: "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "Do you want to catch up on the latest developments in the Drools community for the 7.x series? In this session, we'll look at changes to both the workbench and the core engine—what's available now and what's in the roadmap. The 7.x workbench has had a big usability revamp with improved advanced editors and automated deployments to the execution server. We'll look at a 'low code' example to see the authoring, deployment, and usage of decision service. This example will integrate the new forms and application directory functionality. The workbench is now highly customizable and we'll demonstrate how to add new custom editors and the mash up capability of the workbench to easily add new pages and components for your domain. The 7.x engine delivers a new hybrid reasoning capability to make it much easier to work reactively with nested objects, providing a new XPath inspired notation for list comprehension, making things much more natural for Java developers. And it now has a pluggable layer for different knowledge types, and we'll discuss and demonstrate how to integrate another subsystem such as a Bayesian Network. We'll also demonstrate the new capabilities for default and exception rules and cover pojo-rules that make use of Java 8 lambda for rules in pure Java."

  - title: "DevOps moves to production"
    date: "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29: 10:15 a.m. to 11:15 a.m."
    abstract: "Delivering an app or service fast and frequently to production isn't the same as delivering the app or service fast and frequently to its intended users. Before an app is actually 'live' it has to run the gauntlet of production deployment that stands between it and real, live users. While DevOps has helped organizations make huge strides toward continuous delivery in dev and test environments, the production environment remains a very real obstacle in realizing continuous deployment. The biggest hurdle in that obstacle course is a narrow definition of DevOps that fails to include a broad set of technologies and tools outside the Dev and Ops domain. In this session we'll explore the underlying elements of a comprehensive DevOps approach (SDN, CD/CI, and Agile) and how they mix, match, and combine to enable the operational transformation DevOps promises to achieve the ultimate goal of IT agility: continuous deployment."

  - title: "fabric8-ing continuous improvement with Kubernetes and Jenkins Pipeline"
    date: "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29: 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m."
    abstract: "Using Docker for building and packaging small discrete microservices, and Kubernetes to ensure they stay running and gaining OOTB service discovery, significantly reduces the challenges of having a consistent way to build, package, and run applications. Then, there's how to develop, test, promote, release, support, and improve our container-based architectures, taking an idea from inception to repeatable releasing in a live environment. In this session, we'll look at how fabric8, which runs on top of OpenShift 3 by Red Hat and Kubernetes, uses Docker and Jenkins workflow for pipeline orchestration to provide an extensible OOTB CD solution. Fabric8 significantly simplifies the creation of new projects with a one-click setup and the wiring-together of tooling such and version control systems, artifact repositories, and release pipelines. With human approval, automated integration testing, ChatOps, environment + pipeline visualisation, commit traceability, and a developer experience that helps teams deliver value faster, we'll see how the strength of the open source community works together to provide a consistent approach to building and releasing software for new, cloud-based microservices."

  - title: "Monitoring application-specific behavior using Thermostat and Byteman"
    date: "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29: 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m."
    abstract: "Thermostat is a Red Hat monitoring solution for middleware that lets you capture performance statistics from one or more Java deployments. In this session, we'll look at an extension to Thermostat that allows it to capture and present arbitrary application-specific data in a variety of different formats. By integrating Thermostat with Byteman, a tool that easily injects Java code almost anywhere in a running Java application, the Byteman-Thermostat integration package can gather simple data or statistics and pass them to the Thermostat back end. The back end automatically displays it in a suitable graphical format alongisde all other monitored statistics. Byteman supports un-injection and re-injection of code, making it possible to gather ad hoc statistics and tune in to specific, problematic behaviors. We'll mostly proceed by demonstrating Byteman and Thermostat in action—showing how to set up and run Thermostat with Byteman in place and providing examples of how to gather several interesting application-specific statistics from a sample Java deployment."

  - title: "Write powerful Javascript modules to make your apps DRY"
    date: "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29: 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m."
    abstract: "Large-scale Javascript applications benefit from a modular approach that let code be reused both within the application and across repeated implementations. In this session, we'll look at the modular approach used to build reusable Javascript modules in the Red Hat mobile field workforce management application (WFM) showcased in this year's Summit middleware keynote demo. Reusable modules for WFM are packaged as node package manager (npm) modules, providing a consistent format for both server and client sides using Node.js and Browserify. Modules are loosely coupled using the Mediator pattern and they broadcast user actions and state changes giving the application and other modules the opportunity to hook into those events. Additionally, visual components are packaged in a framework-agnostic manner, providing reusable UI components. You'll leave this session understanding the challenges faced when building reusable modules for large-scale applications, and the solutions employed in building out the reusable WFM modules."
