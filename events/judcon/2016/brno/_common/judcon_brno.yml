  JUDCon is coming to town! After some time of silence, it is about time
  to have another JUDCon. 2016 will start off with JUDCon Brno and we're
  very proud to be part of the DevConf.cz conference with a full day
  track of Microservices, Mobile, Cloud and Java EE.<br><br>
  The JBoss Users and Developers Conferences are developer gatherings
  held around the globe to give JBoss users the chance to talk to and
  collaborate with leaders in the JBoss Community, and to allow the
  project leads and engineers to learn from and collaborate with end
  users.<br><br>
  The JBoss Core Developers, along with the open source community,
  create and support the projects that drive innovation and help lead
  development in standards bodies like the Java Community Process, the
  Apache Software Foundation, OASIS, W3C and other open standards
  organizations.

      As an architectural pattern, Microservices has graduated from being an
      esoteric buzzword and has great potential in many organizations -
      ranging from startups and large consumer internet organizations to
      enterprises. The microservices talks help bring in real world
      experience and first hand information from the engineers working on
      the future.
  - title: Mobile &amp; Cloud

      While mobile left the real hype and turned into commodity for many
      users, the combination with cloud and changing requirements in today's
      enterprises still influence the way we built mobile applications. The
      mobile and cloud talks by our engineers help you to make the best out
      of both.
